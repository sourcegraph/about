                <>
                    <p>Cody Free and Cody Pro are both offered as standalone products.</p>
                    <p>
                        Cody Free is best for individuals working on hobby projects or professional devs trying out AI
                        coding assistants. Usage limits apply.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cody Pro is best for professional developers who want unlimited usage and
                        context for larger codebases. Cody Pro is free until February 2024.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cody Enterprise is for organizations needing security, scalability, and control. It is coming
                        soon for everyone, but is currently available for existing Code Search customers (

            answer: (
                <p>
                    Cody autocompletions are counted based on the number of suggestions that are served to the user in
                    their IDE as ghost text. This includes all suggestions whether or not they are accepted by the user.

                    <p>
                        Cody offers several ways of retrieving codebase context to personalize its responses. One 
                        way is through embeddings, which are generated for user repositories.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cody Free users can create embeddings for up to 200MB of code, and Cody Pro users can create
                        embeddings for up to 1GB of code. Cody Enterprise users can create embeddings for
                        enterprise-scale codebases.

                    Cody Pro is free until February 2024. Prior to February 2024, users will be emailed and asked to
                    enter a credit card if they would like to continue using Cody Pro. If they choose not to enter a
                    credit card, their account will move to the Cody Free plan.

                        Bring your own LLM key: Enterprise customers can optionally provide their own LLM API key for
                        supported LLMs (including for LLM services such as Azure OpenAI and Amazon Bedrock). In this
                        scenario, customers pay for their own LLM consumption and we provide a pricing discount for
                        Cody.
