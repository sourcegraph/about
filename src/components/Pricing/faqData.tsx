                <>
                    <p>
                        Cody Free is best for individuals working on hobby projects or professional devs trying out AI
                        coding assistants. Usage limits apply.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cody Pro is best for professional developers who want unlimited usage and context for larger
                        local codebases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cody Enterprise is for organizations needing security, scalability, and control. It uses the 
                        Sourcegraph platform to provide context of an organization's remote codebase to Cody.
                    </p>

        },
        {
            question: 'How are autocompletions counted for the Cody Free plan?',
            answer: (
                <p>
                    Cody autocompletions are counted based on the number of suggestions that are served to the user in
                    their IDE as ghost text. This includes all suggestions whether or not they are accepted by the user.

            answer: (
                <>
                    <p>
                        Cody can retrieve codebase context to personalize responses in a number of ways. One way is
                        with embeddings, which are generated for local user repositories. Cody Free users can create
                        embeddings for up to 200MB of code and Cody Pro users can create embeddings for up to 1GB of code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cody Enterprise uses Sourcegraph search to retrieve context. This method lets Cody
                        pull context from a team's full codebase at any scale.

                        Bring your own LLM key: Enterprise customers can optionally provide their own LLM API key for
                        supported LLMs (including for LLM services such as Azure OpenAI and Amazon Bedrock). In this
                        scenario, customers pay for their own LLM consumption and we provide a pricing discount for
