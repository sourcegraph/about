                    Everyone's telling us to "shift left" these days. This raises some questions. What's being shifted?
                    Who's doing the shifting? How far left should we be shifting it?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shifting left means addressing important parts of the development cycle early on. Doing this enables
                    you to get an MVP out speedily, receive feedback sooner, and ensure your project is robust enough to
                    handle the journey ahead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So what needs to be addressed? Well, it differs in each project, but mainly you should be paying
                    attention to: user validation, context acquisition, testing, security, and code review.
