                                    curve. AI's potential was incredibly promising: Could it help them continue honing

                                    their most high-security customers? Rob Linger, AI Software Architect at Leidos,
                                    expanded on how they vetted AI coding assistants and the impact Cody is having on

                                        exposure? Given Leidos' clientele across government and defense industries,
                                        security was the absolute highest priority.

                                        — and quickly. How could Leidos have more flexibility to iterate and keep up

                                        assistants are up to the task. What one gets out of a coding assistant is only

                                    Leidos saw huge potential in Cody's context, something they found lacking in
                                    alternative solutions. Per Linger, “we noticed very quickly that the context many AI
                                    coding assistants pulled from was very limited. For the most part, it was your open
                                    tab in the editor, and that was it. But when you're working on a software
                                    development project of any type that's even slightly more complex, you're going to
                                    run into instances where you need to import data from another project or repo.”

                                    And while other solutions don't have nearly enough technical documentation, Cody has
                                    code repos Leidos can sift through. It's much more transparent and open-source,
                                    offering a window into how Sourcegraph communicates with the LLMs.

                                <p className="pb-2 text-lg">
                                    With Cody, Leidos isn't held to a specific LLM. “Generative AI is a fast-moving
                                    field, and the best model that's out there today may not be the best model
                                    tomorrow,” says Linger. “Something better could come out tomorrow. With a lot of
                                    solutions, you're locked into an LLM and putting a lot of faith in that model to
                                    keep up with the pace of change. Using Cody means we can avoid that LLM lock-in.”

                                        To amplify existing contracts already using Cody – Many Leidos customers aren't
                                        able to invest or bring in this kind of technology on their own; they don't have
                                        the budgets or the acquisition pathways to invest or scale like Leidos can.
                                        Leidos constantly looks to transition new technology solutions developed via
                                        their research and development or being utilized on other contracts in the most
                                        economical and impactful way for existing customers.

                                    Scaling was also on the engineers' minds. By capturing the needs and data flows of
                                    these three objectives, Leidos could not only leverage Cody internally within their
                                    own engineering projects, but also externally for customers in different sectors and
                                    with varying levels of security.

                                    One of their bigger conversations revolves around the modernization and migration of
                                    legacy code. For example, migrating from Oracle to PostgreSQL once took a full
                                    sprint, if not longer. Cody got them 80% to 90% of the way there within minutes.

                                    Technology moves fast, and Leidos leans on Cody to teach its engineers the basics of
                                    both old and new technology that they're not familiar with but need to understand
                                    for projects they're working on. Thanks to Cody, they're saving time writing
                                    documentation for their code, generating boilerplate in seconds, writing unit tests
                                    with unparalleled ease which in turn improves code quality, and debugging
                                    significantly faster than before.

                                    cut this down to two. In fact, Leidos lives by one important rule of thumb:
