                            A web performance and security company, Cloudflare offers CDN, DNS, DDoS protection, and
                            security products and services to millions of customers worldwide. The company has
                            approximately 2,000 employees, a quarter of which are engineers.

                        <h2 className="pt-5 pb-1">Looking for a new code search tool</h2>

                        <p>
                            Cloudflare's engineering team builds and runs the software that powers and protects
                            approximately 25 million Internet properties around the world. When performance and security
                            issues arise, it's critical that Cloudflare engineers can find and fix code quickly.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            But using their code host's native code search functionality wasn't cutting it. For example,
                            it would take ASCII characters and run them through ElasticSearch. Special characters,
                            including spaces, were completely ignored and there was no way to filter results based on
                            file types, folder names, or code logic.
                        </p>
                        <InContentBlockquote
                            quote="We were trying to answer questions like who was using specific dependencies and different libraries and where are 
                            these lines of code or log lines coming from. We needed to be able to search thousands of repos to find them."
                            author={terinStock}
                        />

                        <p>
                            For a while, the team worked around this by cloning all the repos onto their machines and
                            using their local system's search functionality. But with over 2,600 repositories, the
                            process proved slow and unwieldy.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            “It would take two days just to copy the repos onto a laptop, so I could search them,” said
                            Stock. Meanwhile, if the code base was updated during the time it took to copy the repos,
                            then the engineer wouldn't be searching the latest codebase. Further, once team members
                            cloned the repos, they wouldn't have space left on their machine for other work.
                        </p>

                        <h2 className="pt-5 pb-1">Finding Sourcegraph</h2>

                        <p>
                            Stock, who was then on the Dev Tools team, and has since moved to Service Automation, knew
                            there had to be a better solution. He discovered the open source version of Sourcegraph, a
                            universal code search and intelligence tool for developers.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Sourcegraph integrates with all code repos, programming languages, and file formats. It also
                            provides advanced code navigation features that let developers explore source code on any
                            branch, commit, or PR.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            "Sourcegraph is the only code search tool that natively integrates with our code and
                            understands how our code works," said Stock.
                        </p>

                        <h3 className="pt-5 pb-1">Expanding throughout the team</h3>

                        <p>
                            Once Stock downloaded and began using the open source version of Sourcegraph, he started
                            sharing search result URLs with engineers. Soon, Sourcegraph spread organically throughout
                            the organization and the internal DevOps team decided to deploy Sourcegraph for all
                            Cloudflare engineers.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now, with Sourcegraph universal code search, Cloudflare engineers can solve the big code
                            problems they face every day. For example, engineers can quickly identify out-of-date code
                            libraries by only searching certain repositories, while excluding specific file types. And
                            it's easier to search for error logs. As a result, the team can refactor and debug faster
                            and feel confident they've addressed each issue.
                        </p>

                        <h3 className="pt-5 pb-1">Finding and addressing security risks</h3>

                        <p>
                            Sourcegraph has also become essential to how the Cloudflare security team can quickly
                            address security risks and root-cause incidents.
                        </p>

                        <InContentBlockquote
                            quote="When a potential security issue comes up, I often have to go into another engineer's project to quickly 
                                    understand how the code works to understand the critical functions, where the data is flowing, what sort
                                    of controls or checks are happening. With Sourcegraph, I can jump into another engineer's project and 
                                    quickly explore and better understand the code faster."
                            author="David Haynes, Security Engineer"
                        />

                        <p>
                            Another plus, according to Haynes, “it's the best way to prove we're not vulnerable to a
                            particular CVE, if and when we get asked by an auditor.”
                        </p>

                        <h3 className="pt-5 pb-1">Saving time, from days to minutes</h3>

                        <p>
                            Whether searching for instances of a library or refactoring an entire application, it's hard
                            to put exact numbers on how much time the organization saves as a result of using
                            Sourcegraph, because it's a 'death by a thousand paper cuts' scenario.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Each time an engineer uses the tool to search and understand code, instead of cloning the
                            repo, he or she saves time and feels more confident in the results. When you have 500
                            engineers searching code repos, multiple times a day, throughout each day, that's a huge
                            time savings.
                        </p>

                        <p>In the end, it all adds up to increased developer productivity -- and better code.</p>
