                                    When generative AI and ChatGPT quickly rose in popularity in 2023, Qualtrics' DevX
                                    team immediately saw the potential to use AI within their development teams. The
                                    team took a primary initiative to evaluate AI coding assistants in the summer of
                                    2023. Godwin Babu, Sr. Manager and leader of Qualtrics' DevX team, hypothesized that
                                    AI usage could significantly improve productivity within their engineering teams.

                                    Qualtrics evaluated several AI solutions in the market before deciding on Cody, and
                                    security was a primary priority. Godwin stated, “When choosing a coding assistant,
                                    we prioritized DLP [data loss prevention] and assurance of the security of our
                                    intellectual property. Cody worked seamlessly with the systems we already had in
                                    place.”

                                    Qualtrics' security protocols extend to their code host, which is why they run their
                                    own self-hosted GitLab instance. Cody works with all major code hosts, both
                                    self-hosted and cloud-based, so it could plug into Qualtrics' existing setup. Per
                                    Godwin, “We run our own GitLab instance within our own data centers, and Sourcegraph
                                    works seamlessly with it. That made signing up for Cody easy.”

                                    DevX team also wanted a solution supporting the latest LLMs so their teams could
                                    always access the fastest and most accurate models. This led Qualtrics back to Cody,
                                    which supports several LLMs as options. “Cody's ability to switch backends, from
                                    Claude to GPT, is very attractive to us. This is a fast-moving field, and we see
                                    updates to LLMs constantly, so having a tool that can react to new LLMs quickly is
                                    important to us.”

                                    unit tests. We see a direct correlation with Cody here since Cody has proven adept

                                    “It's not a secret for developers that writing unit tests is a necessary time sink
                                    in the day-to-day life of a developer for writing reliable software,” per Brendan.
                                    “Generating unit tests, by far, is my number one favorite feature and time saver for
                                    Cody. I can spend my brainpower somewhere else instead of spending it figuring out
                                    how to write tests.”

                                    Brendan's team also gets value from using Cody to ramp up on big codebases and
                                    existing projects, especially for the younger engineers. “One of the most daunting
                                    things as a junior engineer is working on a large, existing codebase. There is
                                    always a ton of domain knowledge about that code that's restricted to the people who
                                    wrote it, no matter how well it's documented. There are always nuances that only the
                                    code authors know. But if developers know how to prompt Cody, Cody can find context
                                    and explain the code to them.”
