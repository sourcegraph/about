                            Lyft's mission is to improve people's lives with the world's best transportation. With over 30
                            million riders in 2018, Lyft's business is growing, as are the numbers of engineers,
                            repositories, and microservices. Effectively scaling and managing a large engineering
                            organization requires an elite set of development tools and practices to preserve efficiency,
                            while protecting, and enhancing code quality.

                        <p>
                            The largest refactoring effort in Lyft's 10-year history came in 2018 when the number one
                            company priority was the decomposition of the PHP monolith to microservices.
                        </p>
    
                        <p>
                            Performing such significant and wide-ranging code changes meant extensive analysis was required
                            to verify all call sites and references to the monolith had been updated. This meant
                            transforming monolith code to consuming the new microservice API endpoints, which in many cases,
                            meant altering an API schema.
                        </p>
    
                        <p>
                            This wasn't simply slicing up the monolith by domain into separate servicesâ€”it was also a
                            crucial opportunity to eliminate tech debt by removing dead code, deprecated libraries, and
                            unused API and database fields.
                        </p>
    
                        <h2 className="pt-5 pb-1">
                            The refactoring and the decomposition of legacy applications is constant

                        <p>
                            With the confidence gained from the successful PHP monolith decomposition, new projects are
                            underway to reduce tech debt by more aggressively tackling migrations and the deprecation of
                            systems.

                            Using Sourcegraph code search, Lyft software engineers were able to verify the migration and
                            deprecation of code from their monolith to microservices at scale, significantly reducing the
                            risk to production stability during deployment of the new microservices.
