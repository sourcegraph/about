                        <h2 className="pt-5 pb-1">Migrating from monolith to microservices</h2>
                        <p>
                            In 2019, FactSet's engineering team started a huge code migration project to transition from
                            a monolithic code repository in Perforce to microservices in GitHub. Part of the reason for
                            migrating involved recruiting and onboarding—new developers often hadn't even heard of
                            Perforce and didn't know how to use it. In addition, moving to a git-based system had
                            technical benefits for FactSet, including increased code stability, fewer failed deployments
                            and broken builds, and a more agile, incremental approach to software engineering.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The developer services team spearheaded the transition to GitHub and met weekly with
                            developers to provide updates and address issues. Soon after migrating the first 20+
                            repositories, the team responsible for FactSet's market data platform, which ingests a huge
                            amount of data from different stock exchanges, brought a major problem to their attention:
                            the team could no longer search the code.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The market data application is structured with approximately 100 different children classes
                            of the same templates, repeated over and over. That structure is part of why the team relies
                            so heavily on code search, just to see exactly which instance of a class is being called and
                            what it is doing.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            “Mid-migration, it became very clear that we had to find an efficient way to search code.
                            Thankfully, we discovered Sourcegraph,” said Derrick Faunce, Associate Director of Developer
                            Services at FactSet.
                        </p>

                        <h2 className="pt-5 pb-1">Expanding throughout the organization</h2>
                        <p>
                            Initially, the developer services team deployed Sourcegraph to the engineers responsible for
                            the real-time news and quotes engine. But after receiving positive feedback, the team gave
                            another 200+ developers access to Sourcegraph. A month later, they surveyed Sourcegraph
                            users to see how engaged they were with the product.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            “The responses were heavily biased towards, ‘I'm using this every day, or even multiple
                            times in any given day,'” Faunce said. Now, over 500 FactSet developers use Sourcegraph.
                        </p>

                        <InContentBlockquote
                            quote="For developers, Sourcegraph is a must-have tool一we need it at arm's length at all times."
                            author={derrickFaunce}
                        />

                        <p>
                            For a large, fast-paced organization like FactSet, code search capabilities are essential to
                            ensuring consistency as well as eliminating duplicative efforts.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            “If I'm developing code for a library that might draw charts, for example, we don't want 30
                            different ways to draw a chart at FactSet. With Sourcegraph, I can search the code to find
                            other chart examples, and simply copy the code. This saves us time and ensures consistency.”
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            “Being able to have code exploration is a base requirement of efficient development,” said
                            Joseph Majesky, Software Engineer at FactSet.” Majesky was one of the developers who
                            discovered Sourcegraph during the transition from Perforce to GitHub.
