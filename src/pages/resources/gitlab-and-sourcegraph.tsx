                            GitLab is the most comprehensive DevSecOps platform in the market today, offering a powerful
                            suite of products to help create secure software faster. To bring even more value to GitLab
                            users, GitLab is designed as an open-source platform to allow easy integration with leading
                            technology partners. These integrations allow organizations to share data between GitLab and
                            the partner's tools to extract more value from both products. GitLab now offers integration
                            with Sourcegraph to provide additional AI coding assistance and code search.

                        <p>
                            Sourcegraph is the Code Intelligence Platform that makes codebases intelligible by
                            semantically indexing and analyzing all of an organization's code and code-related data
                            sources to give dev and engineering leaders a complete understanding of their codebase.
                            Developers use Sourcegraph's Cody, the AI coding assistant, and Code Search to understand,
                            fix, and automate across the entire codebase across every code host, language, and
                            repository.
