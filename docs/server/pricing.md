<div class="alert alert-info">

Sourcegraph is <a href="https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph">open source</a> as of October 2018. Pricing documentation below applies to <a href ="https://about.sourcegraph.com/pricing">Sourcegraph Enterprise</a>.

</div>

Organizations using Sourcegraph can <a href ="https://about.sourcegraph.com/pricing">upgrade to Sourcegraph Enterprise</a> to get the features that large organizations need (single sign-on, backups and recovery, cluster deployment, etc.). These additional features in Sourcegraph Enterprise are paid and not open source.

## True-up pricing

When you purchase a new Sourcegraph Enterprise license, you select and pay for a number of users. <a href=”https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#true-up-pricing”>Like GitLab, Sourcegraph offers true-up pricing</a>, which means the license is never blocking user growth.

Instead, if you exceed the number of users on the license, Sourcegraph will true up your license at your next renewal. This means a retroactive charge for the full yearly cost of a user will be applied for the difference between the maximum number of user accounts at any given time on your instance, and the number of users on the license.

If you want to prevent the retroactive charge, you can upgrade your license to cover a larger number of users at any time. This will allow you only pay for new users as they start using Sourcegraph, and not for the full previous license term.

See your license status any time by clicking **Admin** in the top right of any page, and going to **License** in the left side menu. (The URL is `https://sourcegraph.example.com/site-admin/license`.)
