### How we are delivering:

# The Future Sooner

<br>

The fundamental problem of software development is that most developers spend most of their time doing things that aren't core to solving their actual problem. Of all the code you write, only a tiny fraction is core to your particular business or application. Likewise for the bugs you spend time fixing. Our products aim to solve these issues, and we want to give you insight into where we are heading next.

This page will be updated with our plan for improvements and features we plan to add to Sourcegraph. See something missing from the list? <a class="intercom-toggle" href="#" onclick="window.Intercom('show')">Start chatting with us now</a>, file issues on our [public issue tracker](https://github.com/sourcegraph/issues/issues), or send an email to <a href="mailto:support@sourcegraph.com">support@sourcegraph.com</a> with the feature you'd like to see added to our roadmap.
