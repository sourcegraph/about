Thank you for using Sourcegraph! This page lays out the basic terms and conditions that apply to your use of software, products, and services we make available at Sourcegraph.com.

<div class="p-3" style="background: #f2f4f8; word-wrap: break-word;">

<span style="color:#b200f8;">

## Is this the right Terms of Service for me?

</span>

Are you interested in terms for...

* **A private or self-hosted Sourcegraph instance**: You're in the right place! Read on.

* **[Sourcegraph.com](https://about.sourcegraph.com/terms-dotcom)**: If you’d like to use Sourcegraph.com (the public Sourcegraph instance that can be used to search, navigate, and analyze public code) rather than a private or self-hosted instance, or if you’d like to use any products (e.g. browser or editor extensions) developed and distributed by us for use with sourcegraph.com, please see our Sourcegraph.com terms and conditions at https://about.sourcegraph.com/terms-dotcom.

* **[Sourcegraph OSS](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/master/LICENSE.apache)**: It is possible to run a version of Sourcegraph without some Enterprise features from our open source code available at https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph. If you want to follow the instructions there to build and run Sourcegraph OSS from source, please see the open source license (Apache 2.0) at https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/master/LICENSE.apache.

* **Sourcegraph extensions**: If you’d like to use any extensions made available via our [Extension Registry](https://sourcegraph.com/extensions), please understand that extensions made available by third-parties are not provided by us and are generally governed by separate terms and conditions. Extensions that are developed and distributed by us are governed by these terms and conditions.

* **[Government](https://about.sourcegraph.com/terms-gov)**: Certain features of our software may have their own terms and conditions that you must agree to when you sign up for that particular feature. As an example, if you’re using our software as an employee or contractor of the U.S. Government, our Supplemental Terms for U.S. Government Users at https://about.sourcegraph.com/terms-gov apply. Those terms and conditions supplement these terms and conditions.</div>

PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY TO ENSURE YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF EACH PROVISION. THE AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.

</span>

<span style="color:#777777"><i>**Short version**: We have the right to collect aggregate and high-level data from private Sourcegraph instances, as described in our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) and specifically listed in our [product documentation](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/pings).</i></span>

We may collect data derived from your use of the Software (**“Usage Data”**). A specific list of Usage Data that we receive from self-hosted and private instances is always available in our [Documentation](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/pings) and in the site-admin area on your Instance.

## 5. Data protection

</span>

<span style="color:#777777"><i>**Short version**: Our privacy policy tells you what you need to know about how we use any personal information you provide to us. The internet is a dangerous place and, while we’ve instituted safeguards to protect your information, you understand that data breaches happen and we can’t guarantee perfect security.</i></span>

Data security and user privacy are very, VERY important to us. Please read our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) carefully for details relating to how we collect, use, and disclose personal information you provide to us in connection with your use of the Software.

We have implemented, and the Software contains, commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure Your Code and any other information you provide that is stored on your Instance (which we do not have access to), and any information that we do have access to (such as support emails you send to us, Usage Data, etc.), from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your information for improper purposes. You understand that internet technologies have the inherent potential for disclosure. You acknowledge that you store sensitive information on your Instance, or provide any sensitive information to us at your own risk.

<span style="color:#b200f8;">

## 6. Confidentiality

</span>

<span style="color:#777777"><i>**Short version**: You and we will each protect the other party’s confidential information.</i></span>

6.1 **Definition**.  **"Confidential Information"** means all non-public information disclosed by us to you, or vice-versa, that is designated by the discloser as confidential or that reasonably should be considered confidential given the nature of the information or circumstances of its disclosure.

6.2 **Exclusions.** Confidential Information does not include any information that

1. was or becomes publicly known through no fault of the receiving party;

2. was rightfully known or becomes rightfully known to the receiving party without confidential restriction from a third-party that has a right to disclose it;

3. is approved by the disclosing party for disclosure without restriction in a written document or electronic record; or

4. the receiving party independently develops without access to or use of the other party's Confidential Information.

6.3 **Restrictions on Use and Disclosure**. Neither party will use the other party's Confidential Information except as permitted under this Agreement. Each party agrees to maintain in confidence and protect the other party's Confidential Information using at least the same degree of care as it uses for its own information of a similar nature, but in any event at least a reasonable degree of care. Each party agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized disclosure of the other party's Confidential Information, including, without limitation, disclosing such Confidential Information only to its employees, independent contractors, consultants, and legal and financial advisors (collectively, **"Representatives"**) who (i) have a need to know such information, and (ii) are subject to confidentiality obligations at least as protective of the Confidential Information as the terms of this Agreement. Each party is responsible for all acts and omissions of its Representatives. The foregoing obligations will not restrict either party from disclosing Confidential Information of the other party if required by any governmental body, so long as, to the extent allowed under applicable law, the party required to make the disclosure gives reasonable notice to the other party to enable it to contest the requirement. The restrictions set forth in this Section will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

<span style="color:#b200f8;">

## 7. Term; Termination

</span>

<span style="color:#777777"><i>**Short version**: You may shut down your instance any time. We may terminate the agreement at any time, at which point your right to use the software will immediately expire.</i></span>

7.2 **Termination for Convenience**. Either party may terminate this Agreement, for any reason or for no reason.

7.3 **Effect of Termination; Survival**. Upon termination of this Agreement, you may no longer use the Software, and if any fees were owed prior to termination, you must pay those fees immediately. Any provisions of this Agreement that, by their terms or their nature, should survive the termination of this Agreement shall so survive. For purposes of clarity, your right to use the Software will not survive any termination of this Agreement.

<span style="color:#b200f8;">

You will receive notice of any fee change at least seven (7) days before the scheduled date of the transaction and failure to cancel your subscription will constitute acceptance of such fee change.

8.6 **Renewals**. Your subscription will be automatically renewed and your credit card account (or other payment method account) will be charged as follows without further authorization from you every month, year, or other period you subscribed to. You acknowledge that your subscription is subject to automatic renewals and you consent to and accept responsibility for all related recurring charges to your applicable payment method without further authorization from you and without further notice unless required by law.

<span style="color:#b200f8;">

## 13. Export controls

</span>

<span style="color:#777777"><i>**Short version**: Don’t use our site or software if you’re located in an embargoed country.</i></span>

The Software and the underlying information and technology may not be downloaded or otherwise exported or re-exported (a) into (or to a national or resident of) any country to which the U.S. has embargoed goods; or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny Orders. By downloading or using the Software, you are agreeing to the foregoing and you represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such country or on any such list and you agree to comply with all export laws and other applicable laws.

<span style="color:#b200f8;">

## 14. Governing law; arbitration; and class action/jury trial waiver

</span>

<span style="color:#777777"><i>**Short version**: We’re based in California, so the agreement is governed by California law, and all disputes must be brought there. If you have a claim against us, you’ll work with us to arbitrate it on an individual basis instead of via class action or jury trial.</i></span>

14.1 **Governing Law**. The Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of these Terms shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Santa Clara County, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that Santa Clara County, California is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings if the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.

14.2 **Arbitration**. Read this section carefully because it requires the parties to arbitrate their disputes and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us. For any dispute with us, you agree to first contact us at support@sourcegraph.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that we have not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to the Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof, by binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com. The arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California, unless we agree otherwise. If you are using the Software for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this section shall be deemed as preventing us from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, intellectual property or other proprietary rights.

14.3 **Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver**. WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SOFTWARE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THE AGREEMENT, WE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.

<span style="color:#b200f8;">

## 15. Miscellaneous

</span>

15.1 **Notices and Electronic Communications**. We may provide you with (and you hereby consent to our provision of) notices, including those regarding changes to our terms and conditions, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Site. Notice will be deemed given twenty-four hours after email is sent, unless we’re notified that the email address is invalid. Notice posted on the Site is deemed given five (5) days following the initial posting. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in the Agreement. We are not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us.

15.2 **Updates and Modifications**. We may, in our sole discretion, modify or update the Agreement (or any part thereof, including these Terms) from time to time, so you should review this page periodically. When we change the Agreement (or any part thereof, including these Terms) in a material manner, we will update the 'last modified' date at the top of this page and notify you that material changes have been made to the Agreement. Your continued use of the Software after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Service, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Software.

15.3 **U.S. Government End Users**. The Software and Documentation were developed by private financing and constitute a "Commercial Item," as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 2.101. The Software and Documentation consist of "Commercial Computer Software" and "Commercial Computer Software Documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. § 12.212. Consistent with 48 C.F.R. § 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. §§ 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, all U.S. Government End Users acquire only those rights in the Software and the Documentation that are specifically provided by this Agreement. Consistent with 48 C.F.R. § 12.211, all U.S. Government End Users acquire only technical data and the rights in that data customarily as specifically provided in this Agreement.

15.4 **Waiver**. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of the Agreement will be effective only if in writing and signed by us.

15.5 **Severability**. If any provision of the Agreement is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated from the Agreement to the minimum extent necessary and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions; except that in the event of unenforceability of the universal Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable.

15.6 **Assignment**. The Agreement and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by us without restriction.

15.7 **Survival**. Upon termination of the Agreement, any provision which, by its nature or express terms should survive, shall survive such termination or expiration.

15.8 **Headings**. The heading references herein are for convenience only, do not constitute a part of the Agreement, and will not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof.
