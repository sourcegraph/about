## What types of information do we collect, and for what purpose

</span>

The categories of information we collect can include:

- **Information you provide to us directly:** We may collect personal information such as a username, first and last name, email address, and payment information, when you register for a Sourcegraph account, participate in forums, comment on blog posts, submit a feedback survey, or if you correspond with us.

- **Information we collect from third parties and social media sites:** We may collect information about you from third-party services. For example, we may receive information about you if you interact with our site through various social media, for example, by logging in through or liking us on Facebook or following us on Twitter. The data we receive is dependent upon your privacy settings with the social network. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Service.

We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features of the Services. We may use this information to communicate with you, such as to send you email messages, and to follow up with you to offer news and information about our Services.

## How we use cookies and other tracking technology to collect information

</span>

### Usage information from private or self-hosted Sourcegraph instances

Sourcegraph collects aggregate and high-level information about usage from self-hosted Sourcegraph instances through a server ping. The server ping sends a payload containing data such as total number of users and whether certain features are enabled or in use.

<div class="mt-4 mb-4 p-3" style="background: #f2f4f8; word-wrap: break-word;">For more information about the specific information we have access to, see our <a href="https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/pings">server pings documentation</a>. Customers can contact Sourcegraph at <a href="mailto:support@sourcegraph.com">support@sourcegraph.com</a> to opt out of server pings.</div>

The only personal information collected is the email address of the initial Sourcegraph installer and site admin (or, if that user is deleted or demoted to not be an admin, the first such active site admin). This information allows us to contact the technical administrator of the Sourcegraph instance to deliver information about product updates and policy changes, and for customer development purposes. Other than the initial site admin email address, only aggregates of usage data are sent: no usernames, user emails, user personal information, code, repository names, file names, URLs, or other such private content is sent to Sourcegraph.

### Third Party Tracking and Online Advertising

We participate in interest-based advertising and use third party advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements based on your online browsing history and your interests. We permit third party online advertising networks, social media companies, and other third party services, to collect information about your use of our Service over time so that they may play or display ads for our products on other websites, apps, or services you may use and on other devices you may use. Typically, though not always, the information used for interest-based advertising is collected through cookies or similar tracking technologies. We and our third party partners use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics and market research.

To learn more about interest-based advertising and how you may be able to opt-out of some of this advertising, you may wish to visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s online resources, at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices, and/or the DAA’s resources at www.aboutads.info/choices. You may also be able to set your browser to delete or notify you of cookies by actively managing the settings on your browser or mobile device. Please note that some advertising opt-outs may not be effective unless your browser is set to accept cookies. Furthermore, if you use a different device, change browsers or delete the opt-out cookies, you may need to perform the opt-out task again.

You may also be able to limit certain interest-based mobile advertising through the settings on your mobile device by selecting “limit ad tracking” (iOS) or “opt-out of interest based ads” (Android).

**Google Analytics and Advertising**. We may also utilize certain forms of display advertising and other advanced features through Google Analytics, such as Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. These features enable us to use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick advertising cookie) or other third-party cookies together to inform, optimize, and display ads based on your past visits to the Sites. You may control your advertising preferences or opt-out of certain Google advertising products by visiting the Google Ads Preferences Manager, currently available at https://google.com/ads/preferences, or by vising NAI’s online resources at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices.
