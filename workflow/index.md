# Sourcegraph workflow

Sourcegraph helps [<!-- personas -->](../handbook/product/personas.md) organizations with the following stages of the development workflow:

- **Code:** Unblock yourself while coding by finding answers in the code and every bit of related information.
- **Review:** Review code, find problems early, and share knowledge.
- **Verify:** Uphold code quality standards and comply with required processes on all code changes.
- **Monitor:** Monitor services and quickly respond to incidents in your production environment.
- **Automate:** Automate error-prone and time-consuming workflows such as refactors and triage, coordinated across projects and teams.
- **Manage:** All of your repositories and users, configured and accessible in one place.
