Now that [Sourcegraph is open source](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/sourcegraph-is-now-open-source/), we want everyone to be able to contribute to our code and product roadmap. To make this easy and open, we’re announcing code discussions:

![Code discussions on Sourcegraph demo](https://storage.googleapis.com/github-com-sourcegraph-about-content/code-discussions/code-discussions-on-sourcegraph.gif)

With code discussions, you can:

- Discuss a selection of code that has already been committed.
- See discussions attached to the code, even if lines around it have changed.
- See discussions inline when you browse code on Sourcegraph and GitHub.

> **Note:** For now, you must be signed into Sourcegraph.com to view and use code discussions.

On our [open-source code](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph), discuss the implementation or why we chose certain usage patterns:

- [example: providing feedback about our Sourcegraph extension API](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph-extension-api/-/blob/src/sourcegraph.d.ts#L1-2&tab=discussions&threadID=28)
- [example: asking questions about a pattern used in one of our open-source projects](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph-extension-api/-/blob/src/util.ts#L1-5&tab=discussions&threadID=29)

On our [product roadmap](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/about), influence what we’re building by giving us feedback (see more about our [open product](about-repository.md) approach):

- [example: providing feedback about Sourcegraph's code host integration](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/about/-/blob/projects/sourcegraph-for-gitlab.md?view=code#L26-29&tab=discussions&threadID=27)
- [example: providing feedback about Sourcegraph's planning process](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/about/-/blob/README.md?view=code#tab=discussions&threadID=26)

The [code discussions Sourcegraph extension](https://sourcegraph.com/extensions/sourcegraph/code-discussions) also allows you to see comments inline on GitHub:

If you're as excited about improving how developers discuss code, [give us feedback and tell us what you need](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/about/-/blob/projects/code-discussions-future.md) to use this on your own code (naturally, using code discussions)!

See you in the code discussions!
