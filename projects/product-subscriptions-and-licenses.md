# Sourcegraph license keys
Team: T.B.D.
Dates: Ship on October 1

TODO: This will be updated after the product tier naming is solidifed (see #product channel).

Site admins now have an easy way to enable paid [Sourcegraph Enterprise features](https://about.sourcegraph.com/pricing) on an existing Sourcegraph instance.

When you start a new Sourcegraph instance, you'll be using the features that are free (and open source). You can use these for free forever, for any number of users.

If you need [features available in Sourcegraph Enterprise](https://about.sourcegraph.com/pricing), you can upgrade easily. Just [buy a license](https://about.sourcegraph.com/pricing) for the number of users and duration you need, and add the license key to your Sourcegraph instance. You can initiate this process from your instance's site admin area. (Need a trial? [Contact us.](https://about.sourcegraph.com/contact/sales))

<!-- The site admin area will contain mentions of paid features when there is no license key enabled. For example, the overview page and the users/groups pages will all mention that SSO is available if you upgrade. -->

## Implementation notes

The license key lives in a new site configuration property `licenseKey`. The license key is generated by Sourcegraph and consists of two parts:

* Assertion of a product tier, user count, and expiration date
* Signature of the assertion produced by Sourcegraph's private key

If the assertion is invalid (e.g., it refers to an invalid tier or a negative user count), or if the signature fails to verify using Sourcegraph's public key, or if the license has expired, an error is displayed to any user who accesses Sourcegraph. To continue using Sourcegraph, the site admin must fix or renew the license, or downgrade to only using Sourcegraph Core features by removing the license.

If the number of registered user accounts on the Souregraph instance equals or exceeds the license's user count, then a "maximum user count reached" error message is shown when a new user account is attempted to be created (by signing in via SSO or manually by site admins).

<!-- We will reach out to current Sourcegraph instances that use SSO and that have not yet paid to give them a limited-time trial license key, so they can upgrade without losing SSO. They can, of course, also choose to remain on 2.11. -->
