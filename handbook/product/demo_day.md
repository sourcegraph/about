# Demo day

> NOTE: We are just kicking off demo day and will be iterating on it to make it work well for our team. It's a learning process and we want to make this valuable to folks who demo, attendees, and external folks watching in. Please provide feedback to help us improve this process!

On the **first Monday of the month** directly following [Company meeting](../communication/company_meeting.md), Product and Engineering team members present the latest features and improvements to Sourcegraph.

Demos should be short and easy to prepare for, so that as many team members as possible are able to participate. Demos are recorded for folks across the company, customers, and future team members to reference.

## Overview

All demos are:

- Features, changes, small bug fixes, or behind the scenes engineering work from the last month that are **merged** into main and are **live** (i.e. on [Sourcegraph Cloud](https://sourcegraph.com/search) or [k8s.sgdev.org](https://k8s.sgdev.org)).
- Presented (ideally) by one of the teammates who built it.
- Limited to 3 minutes (or less).
- Can be recorded ahead of time and will be played for attendees (optional).

We are here to help and support you as you prepare for your demo. Kylie or your team's PM will work with you to make sure that you can articulate in the simplest way possible why this new feature is awesome for our community and customers.

## Structure

**1. Intro:** Your name and team

> Hi, my name is \<name>, and I’m on the \<your team> team. Today I’m presenting \<name of your change>.

**2. What/why:** What problem does this change solve? For who? Why did we build it?

> We built this because \<reason>.

OR

## How to get scheduled

When your team ships something that would make a great demo, mention @demoday-schedule in your #progress post, or send a short message to #demoday and you’ll be added to the schedule. Kylie will reach out in advance to plan prep time.

We will keep track of and will organize the schedule in [this demo day schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Te8HQXbUP-LZzoeSG90sN_dWyRgvZEB96uJoKPNbZqg/edit?usp=sharing).
