# Product

Product at Sourcegraph consists of [product management](product_management/index.md), [product design](design/index.md), and [technical writing](technical_writing/index.md). Each of these links will take you to a page with information on how that team works internally; this page contains information that is relevant to the whole company.

The Product team strives to make the following true:

- The team is working on the most important things (listed in the [product roadmap](./index.md#roadmap)) to execute on [our strategy](../direction/index.md) that is moving us forward on [our vision](../company/strategy.md).
- Each teammate has the customer and product context needed (about customer problems, likely future priorities, possible solutions, etc.) to perform their work effectively.
- The product vision and roadmap are communicated well to teammates and everyone outside Sourcegraph.

## Contact

You can reach us at the #product channel or @product-team on Slack. If you have ideas you want to pass on to the product team, check out the [surfacing product feedback](surfacing_product_feedback.md) page.

## Roadmap

Within the product organization, individual product engineering teams set their own goals and roadmaps, and each have a direction page with all the details of what they are working on next and why. There is also an [(currently internal only) presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1o3R8WUIhzzRz0x5laTwVcizOzVWrMBe5MCAz74H45Ss/edit#slide=id.gd8d1ce5e98_0_164) with highlights of planned features from all teams.

## Product team initiatives

Occasionally the product team takes on special initiatives that are not strictly tied to product delivery. Those are tracked here.

### Product led metrics refinement

In an effort to gain more clarity around product success and growth on Cloud, we aim to iterate and decide on the current Sourcegraph user metric definitions for On Premise. Targeting to have the new definition in place in FY21 Q3.

- [Pull Request](https://github.com/sourcegraph/about/pull/4521)

### Improve process for documentating product strategy

Our current [product goals pages](index.md#roadmap) are not always up to date so can't be relied upon by the rest of the organization. They are also mixed in with other engineering team content so it can be hard to find the product direction components. We need to update and organize these pages, and then want to improve this process so that the goals pages are the always updated source of truth.

### Public facing roadmap

We are missing a single source of truth for what is currently on the roadmap. Our customers as well as Sales, Customer Engineering, Customer Support, and Marketing all need to know what is on the roadmap. Today we use several methods to track our roadmap making any one source unreliable. The end goal is to have a single source of truth that is referenced as needed.

### Defining our known product scale

Customer Engineering needs is looking to better undrestand the known boundaries of our product to effectively interact with prospetive customers. As a product team we are pulling together information of existing customer scale. This information combined with our product knowledge will help us proactively identify potential scale challenges.

### Other initiatives

There are a few other initiatives we will be tracking here soon:

- CE / Product communication and prioritization improvements on feedback
- Make sure our current product process is documented
- Experimentation and improvements to planning
- Consolidation and simplification of tooling
