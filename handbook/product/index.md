# Product

The Product team strives to make the following true:

- The team is working on the most important things (listed in the [project roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cBsE9801DcBF9chZyMnxRdolqM_1c2pPyGQz15QAvYI/edit)) to execute on [our strategy](../../company/strategy.md).
- Each teammate has the customer and product context needed (about customer problems, likely future priorities, possible solutions, etc.) to perform their work effectively.
- The product vision and roadmap are communicated well to teammates and everyone outside Sourcegraph.

## [Sourcegraph workflow](../../workflow/index.md)

The [Sourcegraph workflow](../../workflow/index.md) describes how our product fits into the developer workflow.

## [Roles](roles.md)

See job descriptions and responsibilities of roles on the Product team:

- [Product Manager](roles.md#product-manager)

## [Personas](personas.md)

See "[Personas](personas.md)".

## Product planning is continuous

See "[Planning](planning.md)".

## Release early, release often

Each project, no matter how long-running, needs to plan to ship _something_ in each release. The "something" depends on the project. We strongly prefer for it to be a minimal viable feature that is enabled by default. The next best thing is to ship something that is feature-flagged off by default. When possible, larger features should be merged mid-cycle to solicit feedback from the team and customers before the release is cut.

The reason for this is to avoid going for too long without customer feedback (from customers trying it) or even technical/product feedback (from performing the diligent work of polishing it to be ready to release). Lacking these critical checks means we will end up building something that doesn't solve people's problems or that is over-built.

When we have relaxed this in the past, the results have been bad and the overwhelming feedback from retrospectives has been to release regularly.

## Saying "no"

We receive tons of feature requests and bug reports, more than we can handle. This means we must frequently say "no" or prioritize things less urgently than some people would like. Our job is to find the most important things to work on.
