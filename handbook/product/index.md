# Product

Product at Sourcegraph consists of [product management](product_management/index.md), [product design](design/index.md), and [technical writing](technical_writing/index.md). Each of the links above will take you to a page with information on how that team works internally. This page contains information that is relevant to the whole company.

The Product team strives to make the following true:

- The team is working on the most important things (listed in the [project roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cBsE9801DcBF9chZyMnxRdolqM_1c2pPyGQz15QAvYI/edit?usp=sharing)) to execute on [our strategy](../direction/index.md) that is moving us forward on [our vision](../company/strategy.md).
- Each teammate has the customer and product context needed (about customer problems, likely future priorities, possible solutions, etc.) to perform their work effectively.
- The product vision and roadmap are communicated well to teammates and everyone outside Sourcegraph.
