# Product

The Product team strives to make the following true:

- The team is working on the most important things (listed in the [project roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cBsE9801DcBF9chZyMnxRdolqM_1c2pPyGQz15QAvYI/edit)) to achieve our company goals.
- Each teammate has the customer and product context needed (about customer problems, likely future priorities, possible solutions, etc.) to perform their work effectively.
- The product vision and roadmap are communicated well to teammates and everyone outside Sourcegraph.

### Product planning is continuous

<!-- TODO(christina): this was taken from the old docs -->

Planning for a project is a continuous process and can happen at any time, not just between releases. However, the [Product Manager](roles.md#product-manager) should meet with the project team to check in within 1-2 weeks before each release. The product manager should also review the plans for all projects in the next release for overall coherency.

This ensures that projects can work on the schedules that make the most sense for them (subject to the constraint of needing to ship some kind of milestone monthly). A particularly long-term project can have many months of visibility into requirements and plans, and shorter or more experimental projects can be planned with shorter time horizons.

## Release early, release often

<!-- TODO(christina): this was taken from the old docs -->

Each project, no matter how long-running, needs to plan to ship *something* in each release. The "something" depends on the project. We strongly prefer for it to be a minimal viable feature that is enabled by default. The next best thing is to ship something that is feature-flagged off by default.

The reason for this is to avoid going for too long without customer feedback (from customers trying it) or even technical/product feedback (from performing the diligent work of polishing it to be ready to release). Lacking these critical checks means we will end up building something that doesn't solve people's problems or that is over-built.

When we have relaxed this in the past, the results have been bad and the overwhelming feedback from retrospectives has been to release regularly.

## Saying "no"

We receive tons of feature request and bug reports, more than we can handle. This means we must frequently say "no" or prioritize things less urgently than some people would like. Our job is to find the most important things to work on.
