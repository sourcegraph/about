# Product team onboarding

Welcome to Sourcegraph! As a member of the product team, it is your job to be the voice of the user, and to balance that with the goals of the company. For all [roles on the product team](../roles/index.md), you will have a very similar first week. Weeks 2-4 will vary depending on your role and areas of focus, but the high level goals for each week will be the same. 

**[Onboarding buddy](../../people-ops/onboarding/buddy-program.md)**: You will be paired up with an “onboarding buddy” in order to become better acquainted with Sourcegraph team and culture. A buddy will be your go-to person for questions (in addition to your manager and the People Ops team).

## Manager checklist

- Create onboarding Google doc and copy in this page to customize week 2-4 tasks and have a personal checklist for the new teammate.
- Update onboarding doc Week 2-4 with initial projects.
- Grant access to necessary services.
   - [Sourcegraph organization on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/people)
   - Invite to GitHub teams, including [@sourcegraph/everyone](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/teams/everyone)
   - Figma
   - Productboard
   - UserTesting.com
- Schedule a recurring [1-1](../../leadership/1-1.md).
- Schedule daily check-ins for the first week at Sourcegraph to keep up with onboarding and to create space for answering any questions that might come up.
- Create a 1-1 doc and add initial discussion items
   - Onboarding doc - YAYYYYYYY WELCOME!!!!! 🎉
      - Your onboarding doc is to help outline the projects and tasks you have over your first 30 days.
      - This 1:1 doc will be where we take notes on discussions, set goals, and make sure you’re on track.
   - Weekly 1:1 - do you have a preference of time/day of the week?
   - 1-1 meetings - what format do you like? What is most helpful to you for these meetings?
   - How do you like to receive feedback?

## Week 1 - Getting started

Your objective is to get to know the team and learn as much about Sourcegraph (the company and product) as possible. It is your responsibility to be proactive in your onboarding, and it is the team's #1 priority to support you and help set you up for success. Everyone will drop what they're doing to help you. We are so excited to have you on the team and can't wait to get to know you better!

Remember:

- Sourcegraph is an [open company](../../../company/index.md#sourcegraph-open-product-open-company-open-source). Everything here at Sourcegraph is public unless there is a very good reason for it to be private.
   - One of our values is to be [open and transparent](../../../company/values.md#open-and-transparent)
   - Good reasons for things to be private: sensitive customer information, sensitive personal information
   - If you see a "request permission" page for some doc or other resource, it is a mistake. Just ask to be granted access to it (and make a PR to update the handbook so the next person starting is granted access to that system).
- Unlike at many companies, it is OK (and important) to call out when we did something poorly or when something doesn't go well (e.g., a sales pitch falls flat). That helps us be real and do it better in the future.

### Day 1

- Complete [general onboarding](../../people-ops/onboarding/index.md#general-onboarding-checklist)
   - Keep the [guiding principles](../../engineering/onboarding.md#guiding-principles) from the general onboarding page in mind - we are here to support you and you should act like an owner!
- Write your 30-60-90 day objectives in your 1:1 doc with Christina

### Get to know the team

- Schedule individual meetings with each person on the [Product team](../index.md#members)
- Schedule individual meetings with each person on the engineering team you'll be working most closely with (ask Christina if you're not sure who this is)
- Get up to speed on what your team is working on
   - Team handbook page(s), to learn about the team and its internal processes
   - Sourcegraph user docs
   - Team sync docs - review recent meeting notes for context
   - Current tracking issue(s)
   - Join the Engineering Manager weekly updates [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/sourcegraph.com/g/engineering-leadership-status) ([handbook description](../../engineering/leadership.md#weekly-updates)).

### Set up the basics

- [Configure your GitHub notifications.](../../engineering/github-notifications/index.md)
- Familiarize yourself with our [team chat](../../communication/team_chat.md) and join team channels on Slack, as well as any other channels you find interesting. [Product team chat documentation](../../communication/team_chat.md#product).
- Set up your [local development environment](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/master/doc/dev/local_development.md#step-1-install-dependencies). If you encounter any issues, ask for help in Slack and then update the documentation to reflect the resolution (so the next person that we hire doesn't run into the same problem).
   - You will need to run Sourcegraph locally to test and validate work that engineering is doing, to provide early feedback, or to review the UX of recently implemented work.
- [Add Sourcegraph as a browser search engine](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/integration/browser_search_engine). Add another entry for our internal instance: `https://sourcegraph.sgdev.org/search?q=%s`. This also ensures you have access to our internal instance.

### Get to know the product

- Review [product resources](../index.md#resources)
- Learn how the Customer Engineering team gives demos and talks about the product in the [product demo recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1idbCnce5MIvtAV0GOOwgB68zQJB2WmZ9/view).
- Read about [search queries](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/user/search) and perform your first searches.
- Work through the questions from the [Sales Onboarding Quiz](../../sales/onboarding/quiz.md) to make sure you understand key concepts. Feel free to skip any obvious answers and discuss any questions you have or knowledge gaps with your manager.
- Record yourself completing the Sales [10 Step Demo Certification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P6nzAGfpTNysIi2FIcFY7mHX__q0qZ8955NDnWylF4I/edit#).

### Get to know our customers

- [Join as many customer calls as you can](../../sales/onboarding/joining_customer_calls.md) in your first few weeks.
- Familiarize yourself with customer feedback channels
   - [HubSpot](https://app.hubspot.com/forms/2762526/a86bbac5-576d-4ca0-86c1-0c60837c3eab/submissions) surveys
   - [Productboard](https://sourcegraph.productboard.com/insights/shared-inbox)
   - Twitter
   - Slack #feedback channel
