# Technical Writer Onboarding

# Setting up to publish {#setting-up-to-publish}

## Graphics {#graphics}

If your changes include any media, you‚Äôll need to upload it to the Google Cloud Storage (GCP) blog bucket before sticking it in your markdown file. However, if the image is [less than 100kb](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/blob/doc/dev/documentation.md#adding-images-to-the-documentation) in size, it can be added to the /doc folder.

1. Once you have permissions set up, hit up the [sourcegraph-assets bucket](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/sourcegraph-assets/?project=sourcegraph-de&folder=true&organizationId=true_)

1. If you‚Äôre working on a blog, navigate to the **blog/** folder, then upload to the appropriate release folder. If your release folder is missing, go ahead and make a new one. If you‚Äôre working on documentation, we need to create a folder structure, and at time of writing, haven‚Äôt yet. Please check with **@bunny**
4. The [https://sourcegraphstatic.com](https://sourcegraphstatic.com/) site serves content from the sourcegraph-assets Google Cloud Storage bucket. We are using this hostname instead of [https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/) because the latter is blocked by some ad blockers, which means our assets are not visible to many of our users. So the reference URL in the markdown will look like this:

# Setting up to preview {#setting-up-to-preview}

Setting up your local environment will allow you to preview changes you make to the handbook, website, or documentation space before you submit a PR.

### Local environment ‚Äî Mac {#local-environment-mac}

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
This is how you install everything else that‚Äôs needed; Go, Yarn, etc. 
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) \
If you already have homebrew installed, type `yarn install` to get Yarn installed. You‚Äôll need it later. 
- [Gatsby](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/gatsby) and [Node.js](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/node.js)
If you are on a mac, use `yarn` to install Gatsby and Node.js packages

### Local environment ‚Äî  Windows {#local-environment-windows}

This process will be more complicated since our system does not support Windows at a local dev environment. Follow these steps, and get in touch with the distribution team if you have issues, (a few team members) also use a PC.

1. Make sure you have Windows 10 Pro
Check your version using **Windows key** > **Settings** > **About**
1. Install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install). Once it‚Äôs done, [search](https://chocolatey.org/packages/) for Go and Yarn and enter the commands to install. Or just install each individually (see below)
1. Download WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)
1. Follow the instructions in the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) to install WSL, update to WSL 2, and install a Linux distribution. 

| üìù        | Choose a stable version, not necessarily the most recent. At the time of this writing, that is 18.04      |
|---------------|:------------------------|
    
5. Run through the process to [enable systemd](https://github.com/DamionGans/ubuntu-wsl2-systemd-script#ubuntu-wsl2-systemd-script) support on WSL 2:
    - Open WSL
    - Install git using `sudo apt install git`
    - Run the following script and then restart WSL

        ```
        git clone https://github.com/DamionGans/ubuntu-wsl2-systemd-script.git
        cd ubuntu-wsl2-systemd-script/
        bash ubuntu-wsl2-systemd-script.sh
        # Enter your password and wait until the script has finished
        ```
    - Run the following command
        ```
        systemctl
        ```
    - If you don‚Äôt see an error or see a list of units, setup was successful

6. Run through the handbook process to [install dependencies](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/local_development#ubuntu) for Ubuntu:
    - Add package repositories:

        ```
        # Go
        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:longsleep/golang-backports
        # Docker
        curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
        sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
        # Yarn
        curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
        echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
        ```
    - Update repositories

        ```
        sudo apt-get update
        ```
    - Install dependencies

        ```
        sudo apt install -y make git-all postgresql postgresql-contrib redis-server nginx libpcre3-dev libsqlite3-dev pkg-config golang-go musl-tools docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io yarn jq
        # install golang-migrate (you must rename the extracted binary to `golang-migrate` and move the binary into your $PATH)
        curl -L https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/releases/download/v4.7.0/migrate.linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar xvz
        # install comby (you must rename the extracted binary to `comby` and move the binary into your $PATH)
        curl -L https://github.com/comby-tools/comby/releases/download/0.11.3/comby-0.11.3-x86_64-linux.tar.gz | tar xvz
        # install watchman (you must put the binary and shared libraries on your $PATH and $LD_LIBRARY_PATH)
        curl -LO https://github.com/facebook/watchman/releases/download/v2020.07.13.00/watchman-v2020.07.13.00-linux.zip
        unzip watchman-*-linux.zip
        sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/{bin,lib} /usr/local/var/run/watchman
        sudo cp bin/* /usr/local/bin
        sudo cp lib/* /usr/local/lib
        sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/watchman
        sudo chmod 2777 /usr/local/var/run/watchman
        # nvm (to manage Node.js)
        NVM_VERSION="$(curl https://api.github.com/repos/nvm-sh/nvm/releases/latest | jq -r .name)"
        curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/"$NVM_VERSION"/install.sh -o install-nvm.sh
        sh install-nvm.sh
        # in repo dir: install current recommended version of Node JS
        nvm install
        ```
    - Configure startup services

        ```
        sudo systemctl enable postgresql
        sudo systemctl enable redis-server.service

        ```

# Publishing {#publishing}

## The publishing process  {#the-publishing-process}

The publishing process for the website, handbook, and docs is the same as the one listed in [editing the handbook](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/editing):

1. Propose the edits you want to make by creating a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) on the Git repository
    - Because the [handbook is public](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/usage#why-make-this-handbook-public), anyone in the world can see your proposed edits.
1. You can request a review from specific teammates (who will get a notification) on the GitHub pull request page.
    - We don‚Äôt have any rules around who needs to review what changes. Use your judgment (e.g., if your change affects the entire engineering team, request review from the VP Engineering).
    - For minor edits, you can skip review.
1. Wait for the necessary teammates to review and approve your pull request.
1. Merge the pull request.
1. Wait up to 5 minutes for your change to be live on about.sourcegraph.com.

### FYI - When to file an issue in GitHub {#fyi-github}

If you‚Äôre doing something that‚Äôs just part of the normal rhythm of your job, no issue is required. If you find something wrong in one of the docs but don‚Äôt have time to fix it right away, go ahead and file an issue. If it‚Äôs a larger task and requires prioritization, go ahead and file an issue.
