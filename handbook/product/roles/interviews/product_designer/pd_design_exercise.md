# Design exercise

The interview simulates a real-life design collaboration. The goal is to build something together and to understand the way the candidate thinks about design in practice, and to experience their process.

What we want to learn:

- How they think and ideate
- Their facilitation strategy
- How do they approach a problem, what considerations do they make?
- Can they communicate in an organized way? Can they explain their reasoning?
- See purpose section for each exercise

## Prompt

Send the following prompt to the candidate to prepare for this interview:

> Part 1: (~30 min) Pick a developer application (e.g., code hosts like GitHub or GitLab, cloud providers like AWS or GCP, monitoring tools like Lightstep or Sentry, etc) and walk us through what works well and what doesn't. We do not want you to prepare a presentation or script, but should come knowing which application you want to use as an example and be prepared to have a conversation about it.
>
> Part 2: (~90 min) We will give you a specific problem to solve for [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/search) and would like you to walk us through your design process. We will be evaluating the process, not the final outcome of the solution.

## Exercise 1 (30 min): Pick a developer application

### Purpose

This exercise tests the candidate's ability to articulate design problems, design decisions, how they would improve a tool, and get a taste of their process. The goal is to test their core role knowledge about design, to understand their technical knowledge, and how they think about information architecture.

### Questions

Pick a developer application (e.g., code hosts like GitHub or GitLab, cloud providers like AWS or GCP, monitoring tools like Lightstep or Sentry, etc) and walk us through what works well and what doesn't.

Ask follow up questions:

- Why do you think this was done this way?
- What works well?
- Pick two critical user journeys, one that works well for you as a user, one that doesn't.
- How would you change it?
- Continue asking why repeatedly.

## Exercise 2 (~90 min): Sourcegraph exercise

### Purpose/goal

Shoot for flow and continuity of the candidate explaining the phases and tools they are using. We won't expect to have a production ready solution by the end of this or expect this to be the perfect solution. What you're evaluating is not the outcome, but the process. Do not constrain where the process goes, go with the flow. Don't be prescriptive, let the designer walk you through the process. Never say no to the candidate, use "yes and" to direct.

Can the candidate:

- Lead the room, keep the group focused, and facilitate the exercise.
- Handle conflict and remain positive in the face of defeat.
- Get buy in and help participants structure their feedback.
- Document/summarize the outcomes of the discussion.
- Explain the different methodologies available for each stage of the design process.
- Demonstrate competency/familiarity with the phase, and depth and variety of tools mentioned in each phase.
