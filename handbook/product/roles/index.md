# Roles on the Product team

This page lists the roles on the product team.

- Open product roles are listed on the [company careers page](../../../company/careers.md).
- [Interview processes documentation](./interviews/index.md) has detailed steps for each role.
- Because I am paranoid about losing data in Lever, I have a Google Doc for each role with the full job description. These should be used for feedback from our team, and provide a backup data source. These docs are intentionally internal (please see the careers page linked above for open roles!). The docs are all located in this [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a4yzjbqICYXMI7OLmDEDSK0BZD7EMydx?usp=sharing).
