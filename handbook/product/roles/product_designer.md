# Product Designer

We are looking for a self-motivated Product Designer with the leadership skills to be the facilitator of design, and the pragmatism to be the person responsible for producing and executing the design. You will work collaboratively with product and engineering to create a highly functional and beautiful experience that delights a technical audience.

Developers [love our product](https://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2019/11/winning-the-hackathon-with-sourcegraph.html) and rely on it daily to ship and deploy better software. Our passionate users provide a constant stream of thoughtful feedback and love engaging with us to help them and their teams solve their toughest problems.

Our [public roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cBsE9801DcBF9chZyMnxRdolqM_1c2pPyGQz15QAvYI/edit) shows the product priorities for each engineering team and we use [OKRs](https://about.sourcegraph.com/company/okrs) to communicate company goals for each quarter.

- Play a key role in building design culture at Sourcegraph.

We will encourage and support you to:

## Qualifications

- Experience building end-to-end experiences in popular design tools (we use Figma).
- The ability to adapt your tools and processes for the velocity of a fast-paced startup where projects have varying requirement levels.
- Experience with usability testing, customer journey mapping, developing personas, wireframing and prototyping, sketching, and other UX design methods.
- The ability to proactively give maintenance to the design system when thinking about how new concepts impact the whole product.
- A knack for giving and receiving feedback, and explaining the reasoning behind your designs.
- A deep understanding of developers, and a strong understanding of Git and Git workflows.

## Nice-to-haves

- Experience designing developer tools.
- Experience working in cross-functional teams on multiple projects in tandem.
- Experience building or contributing to the design of consumer or enterprise applications.
