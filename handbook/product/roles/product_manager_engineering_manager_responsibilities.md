# Product manager + engineering manager: partnership responsibilities 

An effective partnership between the EM and PM is fundamental to the success of any product engineering team. At the core of having an effective partnership is having a clear understanding of the responsibilities in the team, who is accountable for it, and the expectation of what each party will contribute towards that responsibility. If both parties fulfill their role‚Äôs expectations, trust develops ‚Äì¬†not only between each other, but in the team as a whole.

## Definitions
**Accountable**: The accountability for the responsibility stops with this person. Being accountable doesn‚Äôt mean you have to do all the tasks yourself; however, you should ensure it gets done.

**Expectations**: This outlines the expectation that the EM/PM agrees to *proactively* fulfill in relation to the responsibility in the team. The EM/PM is encouraged to delegate and/or share these tasks with other teammates for the following reasons:

- Share the load
- Encourage collective ownership of the success of the team
- Reduce the bus factor risk
- Facilitate career development growth of teammates

**Stakeholders**: These are the teammates that either have domain accountability, knowledge or insight related to the responsibility and who should be consulted and informed on the efforts of the team. 

## Summary

**Product managers**: you are doing well if you have clearly defined the goal of your team, the incremental milestones toward that goal, the timeline for achieving those milestones, and the progress so far (all likely in the handbook). 

**Engineering managers**: you are doing well if your team is doing well.
