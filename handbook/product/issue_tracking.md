# How we track issues

## Customer requests

Customer issues should reference the link to the company in HubSpot, and should also be given a `customer` label. (This is because any links in markdown will not show up in searches for "hubspot.com").

Pro tip: use the [HubSpot Sourcegraph extension](https://sourcegraph.com/extensions/sourcegraph/hubspot) for autocompleting names and adding customer names to your view!
