# Tools

We use a lot of tools on the Sourcegraph design team. Many of them are tools we use directly in our work, while other tools we use at the intersections with other teams.

Here’s what we use and how they fit together.

## Product, design, and research

- [Figma](https://) is our primary design tool for all levels of fidelity and interactive prototyping.
- [Excalidraw](https://) is our tool for collaborative low-fidelity sketching and ideation.
- [Miro](https://) is our tool for collaborative whiteboard-style workshops.
- [Usertesting](https://).com is our tool for unmoderated user research, which includes participant sourcing.
- [LookBack](https://) is our tool for moderated user research and interviews.
- [Calendly](https://) is our tool for scheduling user interviews and sessions where it’s easier for the other participant to choose a time that works for them.
- [ProductBoard](https://) is where we aggregate all feedback.

- [Amplitude](https://) is where we track and visualize events on the product.
- [Airtable](https://) is a database-like tool that can be handy for managing data in user research.

## Internal collaboration and communication

- [GitHub](https://) is where code reviews, issues, and project collaboration in development takes place.
- [Slack](https://) is our primary internal communication tool.
