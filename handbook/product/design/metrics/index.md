# Metrics

The definition of success for a project should be defined in each project's RFC or Product Document. This definition should include events which can be collected and measured to evaluate outcomes.

The locations and interaction moments where these events will be collected often must be defined within design artifacts.

To define a metric, designers should use a [metric card](https://www.figma.com/file/8qNcDzOXLj1hcOM76WDPN9/%F0%9F%9B%A0Project-Tools?node-id=2597%3A6172) from the [project tools](https://www.figma.com/file/8qNcDzOXLj1hcOM76WDPN9/%F0%9F%9B%A0Project-Tools?node-id=0%3A1&viewport=-1298%2C3150%2C1) library. These cards help standardize the names and description of metrics across the product.

Follow the [guidelines for naming events](../../../ops/bizops/amplitude.md#adding-events-to-amplitude) when defining an event.

- If a large number of events are being collected, consider creating a Metrics page [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/LfQUGTLvfYWxyuFoyQsptB/?node-id=251%3A7408) to identify the locations and interactions where events will be collected.
- Metrics review: consider requesting a review of your metrics definitions from the analytics team before the project goes to development.
