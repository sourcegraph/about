# Visual design

(Update coming soon!)

- Visual design should utilize the Sourcegraph’s Figma based component system
- Dark compositions will be created for each major design
- If new components are required, the following process should be followed:

  - Design component in the Figma file which requires it
    - If creating a component make sure it is prefaced by '\_' so that it is not used while in review
  - Create a proposal frame with the following items:
    - Proposal name and description
    - If changing a component, provide an example screenshot of the existing component
    - Link to a Sourcegraph search showing affected areas of the product
    - Screenshots of current product usage
    - A design that represents the suggested change
    - A clear verbal discrpiption of the suggested changes
  - @ mention a frontend engineer requesting an addition or change to the component system
    - Engineering will approve, requests changes, or request that the designer uses an existing component
  - @ mention a designer and request a review
  - Create a GitHub issue for the component
  - When the GitHub issue is complete:
    - Remove the '\_' from the component name
    - Add the component to the Figma component system
    - Publish changes with a fitting commit message

- Improvements to the Sourcegraph user experience should consider the following in every change:
  - Has the change’s effect on the CLI been considered?
  - Does the language in the UI map to the language in the CLI?
  - Does the documentation reflect the change?
  - Light mode / Dark mode
  - Enterprise / Cloud
  - Signed in vs. anonymous user
  - User permissions
  - Interactive mode / plain text mode
- Process
  - A GitHub issue should be created to track the work
  - Designs are produced in Figma
  - Designs will be announced in Slack and linked in the GitHub issue well before they are complete for review
  - Ensure designs meet the visual design checklist:
  - Ensure spacing is consistent and matches the 8pt grid system
  - Ensure text, colors and other styles match existing styles, if possible.
    - Introduce new text styles only if really necessary.
    - If adding new styles, ensure that they meet our [accessibility standards](../design-and-interaction-guidelines.md#accessibility-standards) and add them to the design system.
  - Review designs for accessibility:
    - Color blind check
    - Contrast check should meet AA standard for small text
  - Schedule and conduct a design presentation meeting if the size of the project requires
  - Receive signoff from stakeholders
  - If components were created in the visual design process, when the designs are signed off on, those components will be moved to the Sourcegraph component system
  - Prepare redlines or an interaction delivery writeup for the engineers. Consider the following:
    - Margin and padding
    - Animation
    - Links and hover states
  - Describe expected behavior of layout for tablet and moble screensizes
  - Due to the low number of mobile and table visitors (< 3%) design comps for these sizes are generally not required
  - Schedule a meeting with engineers to discuss the interaction
- Tools
  - Figma
