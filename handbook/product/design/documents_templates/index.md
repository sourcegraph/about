# Documents and templates

We have several handy templates that we use to get going quick on new work.

## Figma

- [Helpers & Tooling](https://www.figma.com/files/project/12944215/Helpers-%26-Tooling?fuid=872030793297791611) project includes:
  - [Project Template](https://www.figma.com/file/JzufQnpTQtreyfnA3qpmfz/Project-Template), which you can duplicate and use for all new Figma files. It includes some pages weâ€™ve found work well for supporting async work and Figma files as a source of truth.
  - [Figma Basics for Sourcegraphers](https://www.figma.com/file/JH7GVilasQ11c9DdjpZUIF/Figma-for-Sourcegraphers-Part-1) and [Intro to designing with Wildcard DS](https://www.figma.com/file/DrlzSZOwHqIgmpHwMqCWOs/Intro-to-designing-with-Wildcard-DS), which introduce Figma and how we use it in design to anyone who may not be familiar with it.

## Docs

- [RFC template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vUp1A-j5xxnPn_rv3x3rWo8tbXJhIA5NggHLU6UofUc/edit?usp=sharing), which you should duplicate for all new RFCs.
- [One-page research plan template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14xwjn7y6H5JbJEFOqNtlZD54u6etUZt_oHrOHLwmrtg/edit?usp=sharing), which you can use to plan research.
- [One-page design challenge template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sEAZAl4NXTY5R1aklPv70_gg-ASbQDgqy0bT5fnJhoU/edit?usp=sharing), which you can use to frame a design problem.
