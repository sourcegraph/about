## Defining success

We know that we’re successful as a design team when we…

- **Collaborate effectively across disciplines to ship and iterate on a great product experience.** This means that we have a shared approach to the design process, that we build trust with each other and with our colleagues, and we consistently ship design solutions that solve product problems.
- **Feel empowered to act with high agency to make our product, processes, and teams better.** Design is an inherently explorative and iterative process. We value high agency, and we have to actively create an environment of physiological safety, trust, and transparency.
- **Advocate for and ship design outcomes that align with our [product design principles](../design_principles.md).**
- **Improve Sourcegraph’s velocity by helping to ship more usable and delightful features in the first iteration.** Design often means more time up-front, but this reduces time-consuming rewrites, refactors, and technical and design debt that occurs when changes are made during development or after releases.
- **Complete FY22 and quarterly OKRs owned by our teams.** We’re successful when each of us is able to complete our OKRs while contributing to the design team culture and rituals.

## How we work

As a design team, we’re constantly reflecting and improving on how we work.

### Design principles

Our [product design principles](../design_principles) are how we express our shared vision and values while designing for our product. We co-created these principles with members of the design, product, and engineering teams.

### Designing in the open

At Sourcegraph, we design in the open. This is an important part of how we work as a design team, and is a key part of how we apply [our values](../company/values) to our work and thrive in our globally distributed, remote company.

Designing in the open means many things to us.

- **Our work and process is [transparent by default](../../company/values#open-and-transparent)**. By making our work visible to anyone, it’s easy for us to collaborate with others while building trust within our [high agency](../../company/values#high-agency) environment.
- **We share early and often**. Our design process encourages collaboration with other teams at all stages of the product design process, and designing in the open reduces friction and [encourages feedback and shared understanding](./reviewing_design/index.md).

Designing in the open is hard! As designers, it’s easy to want to hold back on sharing until we’re happy with what we have. It can be very uncomfortable for others to see the things we’re working on before we’re ready to share. But designing in the open also challenges us to improve our design communication and makes us better at collaborating asynchronously.

### Design process

Product design at Sourcegraph is low-process and highly adaptive. Every project is a little bit different, but we follow the same general approach where cross-disciplinary project teams move together through **Discovery** and **Delivery** phases.


- **The Discovery phase** provides space for the project team to collaborate on problem definition, [research](./user_research/index.md), ideation and experimentation, [testing](./user_research/index.md), and ultimately to converge on an outcome that the project team agrees to move forward into Delivery.

- **The Delivery phase** is the tactical implementation of the outcome of the Discovery phase, usually by engineering, and results in shipping something that we can then [measure](./metrics/index.md) and evaluate.

These discovery and delivery phases can be as large or as small as needed for the problem at hand. Often, the phases are implicit rather than clearly defined for smaller projects. The larger the effort, the more valuable it is to explicitly plan the activities that take place in each phase.

We avoid siloed work as much as possible. Instead of design and development phases, each discipline is involved end-to-end, and it’s likely that one discipline will be more involved than the others at different moments along the way. Similarly, we avoid hard handoffs as much as possible. When the Discovery phase is complete, every team member should have a deep understanding and agreement around what will move forward into Delivery.
