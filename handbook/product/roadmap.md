## Web

### Product priorities

1. The extension registry is confusing and does not communicate it's value
1. Many developers do not realize Sourcegraph has a browser extension
1. A few high quality non-language intelligence extension would help communicate the value and opportunity of Sourcegraph extensions
1. Webapp consistency
1.

- Sourcegraph extensions drive engagement among developers and engineering leaders
- Lower the barrier of entry to using the browser extension & native integrations

## Wishlist

- Sourcegraph extensions - we have the infrastructure in place and a few good (non-code intelligence) extensions that are enjoyed by many users. We would love to continue to add additional context to code from other services and make those integrations top-notch.
- Browser extension improvements
  - Firefox warnings - getting the extension to meet the standards for Firefox add-ons (some background)
  - Improving UX of the extension to make it feel like a natural part of the code host
- Consistent search results - find a balance between speed and consistent ordering. It can be confusing to get different results each time a search is run, and we should show users the things they care about (prioritize recent repositories, popular repositories, or repositories that are owned by the team they are part of).
- Add support for more code hosts with the browser extension (e.g., Bitbucket Cloud, Gerrit).
- Code host integrations
  - Provide search capabilities from the code host
- IDE integrations
  - Powering language support, including cross repository for organizations with thousands of repositories, or organizations with very large monorepos where individual projects are checked out locally.
  - Adding more context to code using code intelligence, extensions, etc.
