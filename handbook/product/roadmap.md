# Product roadmap

We strive for an outcome-based roadmap: each roadamp item should describe the problem we want to solve or outcome we want to achieve.

## Web

TO DO: below are rough items from a previous web team planning discussion.

1. Webapp consistency
1. The extension registry is confusing and does not communicate it's value
1. Many developers do not realize Sourcegraph has a browser extension
1. The Sourcegraph extension development experience is confusing and there aren't any good examples
1. A few high quality non-language intelligence extension would help communicate the value and opportunity of Sourcegraph extensions
1. Code insights
1. Add support for more code hosts with the browser extension (e.g., Gerrit, Bitbucket Cloud).
1. Provide search capabilities from the code host
1. IDE integrations
