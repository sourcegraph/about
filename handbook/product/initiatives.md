# Product team initiatives

Occasionally the product team takes on special initiatives that are not strictly tied to product delivery. Those are tracked here.

## Product led metrics refinement

In an effort to gain more clarity around product success and growth on Cloud, we aim to iterate and decide on the current Sourcegraph user metric definitions for On Premise. Targeting to have the new definition in place in FY21 Q3.

## Improve process for documentating product strategy

Our current [product goals pages](goals.md) are not always up to date so can't be relied upon by the rest of the organization. They are also mixed in with other engineering team content so it can be hard to find the product direction components. We need to update and organize these pages, and then want to improve this process so that the goals pages are the always updated source of truth.

There are a few other initiatives we will be tracking here soon:

- Public facing roadmap
- CE / Product communication and prioritization improvements on feedback
- Consolidation and simplification of tooling
- Experimentation and improvements to planning
