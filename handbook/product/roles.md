# Roles on the Product team

This page lists the roles and responsibilities of the Product team.

## Product Manager

<!-- TODO(christinaforney): this was taken from the old docs -->

The product manager is responsible for prioritization, which means ensuring the following is true:

> The issues for each release milestone are the most important things to work on.

This is a broader sense of the term "prioritization" that means the product manager must do 3 things:

- **Educate** teams so they can prioritize on their own.
- **Plan** with each team the set of issues to work on for each release.
- **Backstop:** triage unprioritized/misprioritized issues and file unfiled issues.

The right mix of these 3 things depends on the team and what they're working on (and should be agreed on with the team). For example:

- For some teams, the PM will educate and plan by meeting with the team once at the start of a release, and will have a very limited backstop role in between. The devs will be the first responders for triaging issues and will kick off the planning meeting with a well prioritized set of issues to work on.
- For other teams, the PM will be the first to respond to and prioritize issues that are filed on the team.

No matter the chosen mix, the PM is still responsible for prioritization. For example, if the PM doesn't effectively educate the devs so they can plan and triage well, then the PM needs to step up on planning and triage (as a backstop).
