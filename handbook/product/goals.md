## Medium term

### Validated and documented product/design/engineering process

- **Owner:** Product team (PMs + Design)
- **Timeline:** FY20-Q3
- **Status:** In progress.
- **Outcome:** Design is fully integrated into Sourcegraph (we operated for ~1 year without a designer on the team, and we are re-establishing how we do design at Sourcegraph). The collaboration process is documented and well understood (validated through real projects) by the entire team (product, design, engineering). New members to the team can quickly understand how we collaborate. Process exists to create clear lines of ownership and accountability, handoff moments, not to restrict or dictate how to work. Metrics driven approach, quality and commitment to solving problems. We are regularly performing UX audits.
- **Metrics:**
   - Documented in the handbook

### Perform a customer journey map of Sourcegraph

- **Owner:** Product team (PMs + Design)
- **Timeline:** FY20-Q3
- **Status:** Not started.
- **Outcome:** We understand the biggest pain points in the customer experience, backed by data. We have a clear understanding of inconsistencies and gaps across the product. This will enable us to prioritize improving existing against new functionality based on the impact it will have to the business. We have documented personas, and we understand their journey through the product life cycle.

### Increase customer funnel of feedback

- **Owner:** Product managers
- **Timeline:** FY20-Q3
- **Status:** In progress.
- **Outcome:** We are even more closely tapped into the customer experience, feedback, and voices. We are categorizing and surfacing insights weekly. We have increased the quality, frequency, and quantity of feedback from customers. This applies to both asynchronous and synchronous forms of feedback.

## Short term

### Design and component system for design and engineering collaboration

- **Owner:** Designers
- **Timeline:** ~1 month (Sept 2020)
- **Status:** In progress, currently contracting on UpWork to fill in gaps for core components of the design system for designers and developers.
- **Outcome:** Designers have a full system of components that they can use for design that is in sync with Storybook. It is clear when a new component is being created for both design and engineering. Engineering receive designs that use our existing components.

### Onboarding

- **Owner:** Rob
- **Timeline:** ~2 months
- **Status:** In progress.
- **Outcome:** New users have better retention. Increase usage of new users. Get new users to understand the value proposition of Sourcegraph.

   - Week 2 retention
   - Search learning curve metric

### Increase visibility and discoverability of core Sourcegraph features

- **Owner:** Alicja
- **Timeline:** ~2 months
- **Status:** In progress, currently working on Extension discoverability.
- **Outcome:** Increase user understanding of extensions, browser extension, saved searches. Improvements to information artchitecture and design consistency.
- **Metrics:**
   - Increase visits
   - Increase creation of and usage of extensions
   
### Create baseline for public (and eventually private) code on Sourcegraph Cloud

- **Metrics:**
   - To be determined
