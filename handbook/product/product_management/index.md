# Product Management

## Vision

The Product team strives to make the following true:

- The team is working on the most important things (listed in the [project roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cBsE9801DcBF9chZyMnxRdolqM_1c2pPyGQz15QAvYI/edit?usp=sharing)) to execute on [our strategy](../../../direction/index.md) that is moving us forward on [our vision](../../../company/strategy.md).
- Each teammate has the customer and product context needed (about customer problems, likely future priorities, possible solutions, etc.) to perform their work effectively.
- The product vision and roadmap are communicated well to teammates and everyone outside Sourcegraph.
