# MyProductArea Direction

This page outlines the vision, strategy and goals of the MyProductArea team.

# Vision

#### 1 Year vision

> Add a sentence or two here indicating what the most important things you want to achieve/problems you want to solve in the next year are. These should in most cases move your three and ten year visions forward.

#### 3 Year vision

> Some vision

#### 10 year vision

> A sentence or two on your ten year vision is where you can really go wild and describe the problems you want to solve and solutions you want to deliver unbound by limitations of technology or scope. Be inspiring and look to the our [10 and 30 year strategies](../../company/strategy#sourcegraph-strategy) for ideas.

## Top customer, support, sales and marketing issues

- What are the top issues from customers we are taking on this quarter?
- What are the top requests from other teams at Sourcegraph we are taking on this quarter?

## What we're not working on
