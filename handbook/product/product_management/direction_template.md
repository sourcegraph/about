# Vision, Strategy, and Roadmap Template

> ℹ️  The following is a template for use on the pages of specific product & engineering teams, used to record and share the vision, strategy, and roadmap.<br>Copy to your team's page and complete accordingly. Other sources of truth (such as Q3 one-pagers) should have their content integrated here and then be marked as deprecated.

> As you write this document, keep in mind that focusing on problems to solve more than lists of features tends to be a better way to approach communicating with customers, as it leaves room for learning between what you know now and what you deliver in the end. This is not to say you never talk about features, but especially as you get [further out in planning](https://medium.com/@jobv/the-nearsighted-roadmap-57fa57b5906a) the blend of features vs. problems to solve should move more towards the latter.

> Be sure also to explain [why something is part of your direction](https://medium.com/leadership-motivation-and-impact/the-power-of-starting-with-why-f8e491392ef8). What you are doing is interesting, but why you have chosen that of all the possibilities is often even more enlightening.

# Mission & Strategy

What is the team's reason for existing? What is the fundamental value they aim to provide?

What is your strategy defined in a few steps?

# Vision

#### 1 Year vision

> Add a sentence or two here indicating what the most important things you want to achieve/problems you want to solve in the next year are. These should in most cases move your three and ten year visions forward.

#### 3 Year vision

> Add a sentence or two here describing what your product will be like in three years, also focusing on the problems you'll solve and the value you'll deliver. This should be grounded in reality, but three years is a lot of time - be ambitious!

#### 10 year vision

> A sentence or two on your ten year vision is where you can really go wild and describe the problems you want to solve and solutions you want to deliver unbound by limitations of technology or scope. Be inspiring and look to the our [10 and 30 year strategies](../../company/strategy.md#sourcegraph-strategy) for ideas.

# Guiding principles

Identify what key principles, insights, and decisions are important to the strategy or a set of key hypotheses and set of key questions to validate or invalidate them.
Describe the target by which we prioritize:

- Market or audience
- Personas
- Jobs or Use Cases
- Industries
- What matters to us when we prioritize products and features
- Contextual things that matter to Sourcegraph or the product

## Themes

What are high level themes or principles you are using to guide prioritization within your three year strategy, and why? What are the groupings of features/problems to solve that you are focusing on in that period?

> Examples:
>
> - A product differentiator
> - Cloud-first
> - Adoption

- What is on the critical path for growth?
- How does the product fit within Sourcegraph as a whole?

## Competitive landscape

- Who is the competition for this product area?
- What recent developments in competition is impacting sales, marketing and product strategy?

## Analyst landscape

- Are there analysts tracking this product area?
- How are analysts positioning the product? What are areas of improvement?

# What's next and why

What are we going to do in the next quarter, and how does it accomplish company goals and the product vision?

## Top customer, support, sales and marketing issues

- What are the top issues from customers we are taking on this quarter?
- What are the top requests from other teams at Sourcegraph we are taking on this quarter?

## What we're not working on

What are we explicitly not working on? Are there frequent requests from customers or other teams we are choosing not to take on? Making that explicit makes other teams understand the strategy and reduces back and forth.
