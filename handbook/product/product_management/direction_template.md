# Vision, Strategy, and Roadmap Template

> ℹ️  The following is a template for use on the pages of specific product & engineering teams, used to record and share the vision, strategy, and roadmap.<br>Copy to your team's page and complete accordingly.

>As you write this document, keep in mind that focusing on problems to solve more than lists of features tends to be a better way to approach communicating with customers, as it leaves room for learning between what you know now and what you deliver in the end. This is not to say you never talk about features, but especially as you get [further out in planning](https://medium.com/@jobv/the-nearsighted-roadmap-57fa57b5906a) the blend of features vs. problems to solve should move more towards the latter.

# Vision

#### 1 Year vision

> Add a sentence or two here indicating what the most important things you want to achieve/problems you want to solve in the next year are. These should in most cases move your three and ten year visions forward.

#### 3 Year vision

> Add a sentence or two here describing what your product will be like in three years, also focusing on the problems you'll solve and the value you'll deliver. This should be grounded in reality, but three years is a lot of time - be ambitious!

#### 10 year vision

> A sentence or two on your ten year vision is where you can really go wild and describe the problems you want to solve and solutions you want to deliver unbound by limitations of technology or scope. Be inspiring and look to the our [10 and 30 year strategies](../../company/strategy.md#sourcegraph-strategy) for ideas.

What are we going to do in the next quarter, and how does it accomplish company goals and the product vision?

## Top customer, support, sales and marketing issues

- What are the top issues from customers we are taking on this quarter?
- What are the top requests from other teams at Sourcegraph we are taking on this quarter?

## What we're not working on

What are we explicitly not working on? Are there frequent requests from customers or other teams we are choosing not to take on? Making that explicit makes other teams understand the strategy and reduces back and forth.
