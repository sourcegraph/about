### Sourcegraph.com

#### Pre-Launch
1. User testing
- Hallway test with internal users.
- Open the feature to internal users by turning it on for the Sourcegraph organization. Make sure it's opened with enough
time left before planned launch date to receive and address all the feedback received. 
2. Design Checklist
- Test the feature for both themes, Light and Dark. Look out for icon consistency.
- Test on small, medium, large and extra-large screen sizes.
3. Approvals
- Receive approval from engineering, design, product and other stakeholders before launch.
4. QA Checklist
- Track and ensure high priority bugs in GitHub issues. Ensure they are closed before launch.
- Track all lower priority bugs that have to be fixed soon.
