# Tracking & sharing user feedback

Our passionate users provide a constant stream of thoughtful feedback and love engaging with us to help them and their teams solve their toughest problems. This trust and feedback is a gift, and we take it seriously and listen carefully to what users tell us.

## Sources of feedback

- GitHub issues
- Twitter
- Slack
- Support emails
- Support tickets
- Sales feedback
- HubSpot forms
- NPS survey
- Browser extension uninstall feedback
- Product feedback

### Email lists

We have a few different email lists that are used to send us feedback.

#### hi@sourcegraph.com

- **Purpose:** This email list is used as the reply-to for our release emails, and is a general way for people to reach out and get in touch.
- **Owner:** The product team owns replying to all incoming emails, and routing them as appropriate to Support, Sales, Hiring, etc.

#### feedback@sourcegraph.com

- **Purpose:** This email list is used to request feedback from inside of Sourcegraph, and to give to customers to reach our product team with their feedback directly.
- **Owner:** The product team owns replying to all emails, and triaging all feedback delivered.

#### support@sourcegraph.com

- **Purpose:** This email list is for customers to request help and creates tickets in JIRA for our Customer Engineering team.
- **Owner:** The Customer Engineering team is responsible for all support issues and will pull in as needed engineering teams or product to help answer questions.


## Productboard

We aggregate all of this feedback in [productboard](https://sourcegraph.productboard.com/). This lets us look at all of the sources of feedback to better understand which features will have the biggest impact on the product. It helps with prioritization and making sure we're building the next most important thing. It also helps us maintain a long-term source of truth for feedback: some of our sources of feedback are subject to removal over time due to retention policies, so adding specific insights to productboard captures it for the future.

### Adding feedback to productboard

All of the above sources of feedback (with the exception of HubSpot forms) require the team help forward that data into productboard using an available integration:

- **Slack integration:** Hover on a message containing feedback, select the more actions menu (three vertical dots), and then choose 'Push to productboard'.
- **[browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/productboard-make-product/mlpbdkpkicfkhgagnoamdcimmhdkakni?hl=en):** Use the browser extension for quick entry from a web page, or to just simply enter information when you think of it.
- **[forwarding email address](mailto:inbox-hkpsum5melnwcauyjvztbtsq@inbound.productboard.com):** You can forward email threads, or write notes as emails to push information to productboard.

## Sharing user feedback

Whenever possible, please use productboard links to share specific user feedback with others and in documents like RFCs. If something is worth sharing and doesn't already exist in productboard, it's the perfect opportunity to add it to productboard!
