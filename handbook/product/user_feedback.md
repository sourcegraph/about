# Tracking user feedback

Our passionate users provide a constant stream of thoughtful feedback and love engaging with us to help them and their teams solve their toughest problems. This trust and feedback is a gift, and we take it seriously and listen carefully to what users tell us.

## Sources of feedback

- GitHub issues
- Twitter
- Slack
- Support emails
- Sales feedback
- HubSpot forms
- NPS survey
- Browser extension uninstall feedback
- Product feedback

## Productboard

We aggregate all of this feedback in [productboard](https://sourcegraph.productboard.com/). This lets us look at all of the sources of feedback to better understand which features will have the biggest impact on the product. It helps with prioritization and making sure we're building the next most important thing.

### Adding feedback to productboard

All of the above sources of feedback (with the exception of HubSpot forms) require the team help forward that data into productboard using:

- Slack integration
- [browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/productboard-make-product/mlpbdkpkicfkhgagnoamdcimmhdkakni?hl=en)
- [forwarding email address](mailto:inbox-hkpsum5melnwcauyjvztbtsq@inbound.productboard.com).
