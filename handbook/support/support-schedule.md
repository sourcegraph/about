# Support Team Schedule

Being an [all-remote](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/company/remote) company means that we can choose to work when we want. This is absolutely true for CSEs and it is also a little more complicated for us. We have to coordinate a little more so we can honor our [service level agreements (SLAs)](../support/index.md#our-service-level-agreements-slas).

This starts by everyone on the team identifying their ideal working hours. If we have good coverage, we are set! If we have gaps, we work together to figure out a solution.

Our schedule also makes it clear when folks on the team have dedicated heads-down focus time. Working out of a queue can be tiresome and to keep the team engaged and able to continuously grow, when each team member reaches 90 days, they choose a focus day. On their focus day, it's up to each person how they spend that time. They can work on their tickets, they can learn something, they can work on a project, they can rest -- everyone maintains their own agency in what they decide to do. And if ever it feels hard to do the thing someone wants, bring that to your manager and we can sort it out.

## Schedule
Our schedule is reflected in the working hours set in our calendars and blocks held on our calendar for our focus blocks.

## Adjusting the schedule
* **Ad-hoc adjustments** can be shared in the team Slack channel (#customer-support-internal).
* **Lasting adjustments** can be discussed in our weekly 1:1s.

If an adjustment creates a gap in covering our SLAs, we will figure it out!
