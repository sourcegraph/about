# FY22Q2 OKR Plan

In support of our product/engineering Q2 objective to *provide a solid organizational and developer experience foundation to scale team 2x this year*, one way we will measure our success in achieving this goal is for the **Customer Support team to maintain 100% support issue resolution within 8 days while only requiring help (filing a #rfh Github issue) on 15% (measured during last month of quarter)**. To accomplish this, we will…

1. Create a tool available in our docs and to customers with commands we regularly use in troubleshooting and what the commands help identify
2. Create scripts customers can run that pull together a file with the information we need most often in troubleshooting (values, logs, etc) so that we can ask for one thing and get the majority (if not all) the information we need while troubleshooting
3. Identify test environments we need and either secure access or create command line app to enter needed parameters and create the environment needed
(entire team) Make at least 50 doc updates/additions based on tickets that the team resolves (where a doc would have helped resolve it faster)
4. Complete how-to troubleshooting documentation for at least 5 of the most common issues we see from some combination of issues resulting from distribution, core app, search, and/or extensibility
5. Publish “what we test + recommend” document (aka “what we support)
6. Receive crash course in at least 3 of these topics
	7. Linking the basics of Sourcegraph to debugging.
	8. Something like starting with the basics of Sourcegraph, going into components of the product, then a high level intro of the more technical stuff on how to troubleshoot and debug.
	9. Anything that would give us a solid grasp of where to get started with a variety of issues, walkthroughs of various tools we can use (or have customers use), like how to use Grafana to troubleshoot customer issues like xyz…
	10. Common alerts/errors and where to go next
	How to begin troubleshooting a slow search…
	11. A walkthrough of networking principles for services in Sourcegraph. - Lectures on the behavior and code structure of each microservice in Sourcegraph
	12. The hidden configs/stream search that the customers know about but not on docs, like tls.external.
	13. A quick rundown of the best way to write queries and structural search
	14. Anything Kubernetes
14. Receive comprehensive feedback on 25 cases, identifying what you are doing well and any suggestions for growth
15. Receive crash course in how to navigate difficult conversations with customers (delivering hard to hear news, keeping calls productive and on time, etc)
16. Update onboarding to good enough v2 for next new hires
