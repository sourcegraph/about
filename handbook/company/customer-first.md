# Being a customer-first company

Some companies are engineering-first or sales-first, meaning they consider how that part of the organization needs to work to be successful and everything else is informed from there. Sourcegraph is a customer-first company. Our goal is to always do what is in the best interest of the customer while simultaneously setting up Sourcegraph and each team within it for long term success. This handbook page documents what this means and how it plays out day-to-day.

Simply, this all boils down to two things we want to be true and can often feel competing:

1. We want to do what is in the best interest of the customer, setting them up for success and in such a way that they trust us
2. We want to make decisions that also set-up Sourcegraph for long term success and result in scalable and sustainable ways of doing things

This means that everyone involved needs to be prepared to honor the area of ownership each other has and have hard conversations to get to the best answer in this spirit.

In terms of responsibilities, we frame it like this:

* Sales is responsible for establishing, retaining, and growing our commercial relationship with customers
* Customer Engineering (aka CE) is responsible for educating our users on how to use Sourcegraph, providing proactive technical expertise, and is overall accountable for our customers’ success, usage, and adoption of our products
* Effective 2021-08-01, Customer Support (aka CS) is responsible for satisfying support SLAs for customers pre-sales (1 hour) and post-sales (defined contractual [SLAs](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/support#slas)) between 2am-5pm pacific Monday-Friday (this will expand to 24/5 support as the team grows over the course of FY22). Between now and 2021-08-01, as the CS team hires and onboards additional folks, they will adhere to a 24 hour SLA for all pre-sales issues between 9am-5pm pacific Monday-Friday.
* Product is responsible for the overall success of the product, including prioritization of support-driven, eng-driven, and product-driven efforts
* Engineering is responsible for giving accurate time estimates (necessary for effective prioritization) and providing enough engineering capacity to respond to interrupts (non-defect, non-feature request issues filed by CS)

In terms of how that plays out day to day, we frame it like this:

* We want sales to focus on moving things through the sales cycle as quickly as possible
* We want CS, product, and engineering to ask whether there are any negative consequences and surface those for the organization to consider
* We want CE to bridge the gap so that we get to the best answer possible for our customers and for Sourcegraph


This is how this all fits together in terms of workflow:

* Once a customer agrees to move forward with first a trial, and again when they agree to move forward with a production set-up, the CE offers proactive coaching and guidance to set-up the customer for success
* At any point pre-sales or post-sales (ie while setting up a trial or production deployment), the customer may need:
	* An answer to a how-to question
	* To make a feature request
	* Help troubleshooting something not working correctly


Currently, CEs are responsible for answering all how-to questions and handling all feature requests (whether these come up pre- or post-sales). Similarly, CS is responsible for troubleshooting something not working correctly (whether these come up pre- or post-sales), taking into account the prioritization considerations as provided by CEs, and effective 2021-08-01, adhering to our contractual [SLAs](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/support#slas) post-sales and 1 hour internal SLA response time pre-sales between 2am-5pm pacific Monday-Friday (this will expand to 24/5 support as the team grows over the course of FY22) -- between now and 2021-08-01, as the CS team hires and onboards additional folks, they will adhere to a 24 hour SLA for all pre-sales issues between 9am-5pm pacific Monday-Friday. As CS continues to hire during FYQ2 and new folks are onboarded, CS will also take on responsibility for how-to questions and feature requests for non-strategic customers.

A few notes for CE:


* If CE doesn’t know the answer to a how-to question, they ask for help in the ask-product-eng Slack channel. This channel is monitored by product, engineering, and CS and is a best effort approach (ie, there is no SLA for when someone might expect an answer).
* Any other request for help from engineering should go through CS (for troubleshooting) or product (for feature requests) and not to engineering directly (for example, CEs are welcome to start troubleshooting and issue, but if they get stuck, the next step is to engage CS and CS will take responsibility for resolution and customer communication from there)
* CE routes all feature requests to product for consideration and prioritization
* If a CE feels compelled to let a customer know CS will help them, they should do so without using loaded terms like “ASAP” or that sign-up CS for something they may not be able to honor
	* *A member of our support team will help you with this. They typically are able to start digging in within a few hours at most, so you are in good hands! If anything has changed on your side to make this more urgent, let me know and I can be sure they are aware, too.*
* CE should always provide as much context as possible to CS as outlined [here](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/ce/team-culture#customer-support-engineers-cses)

A few notes for CS:

* CS follows [this workflow](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/support/support-workflow).
* If CS gets stuck, they engage engineering for help as outlined [here](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/support/engaging-other-teams).
* CS is responsible for holistic prioritization of all issues they are handling (outlined [here](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/support/support-prioritization)), including all issues routed to any one engineering team. Whenever there is too much work for any one team to do, the head of CS gathers context from sales and CE to inform what order of work is best for Sourcegraph. This conversation happens in the #customer-support channel for visibility and clarity to everyone involved.


There will be times when an AE or CE is concerned that CS or product have not made a decision that is in the best interest of the customer. In these situations, the AE goes to the CE. The CE then digs in and may agree with or challenge the AE. It is very common during this process for a CE to engage CS and for CS to push back based on what they know is happening across all customers and a sense of holistic prioritization. If CE is unable to get to resolution, diffuse the situation with the customer, and/or feels stuck, they bring in the VP CE, who goes through a similar process, and if needed, brings in VP sales, VP product, and/or head of CS in order to reach resolution.
