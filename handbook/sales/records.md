# How to record emails, calls, and notes

The [source of truth for our communications with customers is Salesforce](../communication.md). 

- All emails interacting with a customer must be logged to Salesforce (either by using [Einstein Activity Capture](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=einstein_sales_aac.htm&type=5 or by manually adding the email to the relevant object).
- Notes from all phone calls with customers should be logged in Salesforce. The call notes should be logged to the Opportunity, rather than the Contact or Account.
