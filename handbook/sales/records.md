# How to record emails, calls, and notes

The [source of truth for our communications with customers is HubSpot](../communication.md). 

- All emails interacting with a customer must be logged to HubSpot (either by using the HubSpot Chrome extension to add a "Log" checkbox in Gmail, or by BCC'ing our HubSpot account's private ingestion email address (see the "HubSpot BCC email address" note in 1password).
- Notes from all phone calls with customers should be logged in HubSpot. The call notes should be logged to the Deal, rather than the Contact or Customer (i.e., `/deal/` should appear in the URL). Click on the **Calls** tab at the top of the deal overview, and click the **Log Call** button.
