# How and when to engage with security

### Security questionnaires

The CE team should take the first pass on inbound questionnaires using the [list of reference questionnaires](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11X8xoX9lK7aHY-UqZQIwQl_aQ8NQFu1D) we have collected in our shared drive. Once the first pass is done, sign up for a security questionnaire review in [this signup sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q6J8ZwPYDX-jJ0YU2l2CWXX3qboKD2XTbIeg5Q-NBAk/edit#).


### Customer security questions

If customers have specific security questions, first run them by the #ce slack channel. If nobody has context, or we're unsure of how to phrase things, crosspost to #security-team.
