# How and when to engage with security

### Security questionnaires

The CE team should take the first pass on inbound questionnaires using the [list of reference questionnaires](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11X8xoX9lK7aHY-UqZQIwQl_aQ8NQFu1D) we have collected in our shared drive. Once the first pass is done, post a link to the completed questionnaire in the #security-chat slack channel, and the security team will take a final pass within 2 weeks. 

### Customer security questions

If customers have specific security questions, first run them by the #ce slack channel. If nobody has context, or we're unsure of how to phrase things, crosspost to #security-team.
