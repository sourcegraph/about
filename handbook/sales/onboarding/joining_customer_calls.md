# Joining customer calls

Joining customer calls is a valuable part of any new team member's onboarding or ongoing work. It helps someone quickly learn what customers are directly interested in, and how we communicate the product to them.

## Types of calls

While calendar events won't have one of these exact lables, knowing the types of calls will help you categorize calls so you can join the ones you'll find most helpful. 

1. **New prospect:** the first call with a prospect, who may not know much about Sourcegraph. Often named "Intro Call."
1. **Installation:** to walk through setting up Sourcegraph with a technical point of contact.  
1. **Trial check-in:** to discuss how things are going during a trial.
1. **Training session:** a demo walkthrough of common use cases, an advanced tutorial, or a Q&A, all a customer's end users. Often have names like "Sourcegraph 101," "Webinar,"" "Demo," "Q&A.""
1. **Existing customer check-in:** to hear how things might be improved or learn about exciting ways a customer is using Sourcegraph. 

## How to join calls to listen

To join in on calls, you should first see which calls are happening that week and then slack message the event organizer to ask if you can join. Everyone's calendars are public, so look at Sales or CE team members' calendars to find calls. 

If you're working on a project and you want to make sure you're added to calls with specific subjects, you can also post in the #CE and #sales slack channels. 

You should feel comfortable asking to join any call â€“ it's up to the call organizer to let you know if you can't join for any reason. In return, it's expected that if you're "joining a call," it is only to silently observe. 

## How to join calls to speak

If you want to speak directly with customers, you should first post in the #CE and #sales channels what you'd like to talk about and with what (types of) customers. Then you'll work with the CE and Sales team members directly to set up or join existing calls in order to get what you need.
