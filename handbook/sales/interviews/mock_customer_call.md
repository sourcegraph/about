# Mock customer pitch

This sales interview module lets you demonstrate how you run customer calls effectively.

- "You" refers to the candidate being interviewed.
- "We" and "us" refer to the Sourcegraph team members interviewing you.

## Preparation

You choose the mock scenario:

- You choose the company and product you're selling.
- You choose the prospective customer and persona for us to impersonate.
  - In most cases, we'll have enough general knowledge to be able to impersonate this persona effectively. If we can't, we'll tell you, and you can give us a different assignment.
- Make these choices based on a company, product, and prospective customer that you are familiar with.
  - We want to test your actual knowledge of a product you've previously sold and your communication style, strategy, and choices.
  - Ideally, your choice highlights your strengths and is relevant to what you'd do at Sourcegraph.
  - **Do not** choose to sell Sourcegraph in this mock pitch. This interview module is not about testing your knowledge about Sourcegraph.
- The total length should be 40 minutes.
  - 30 minutes is for the mock call.
  - 10 minutes (at the end) is for a debrief where we are not in character.

When you've chosen these things, send us an email to schedule the interview that includes these details. Here's an example:

> Alice, Bob,
>
> My colleague Carol enjoyed speaking with you at AWS re:Invent yesterday. As promised, I'm following up to find a time to show you how our product (ABC Corp's FooBar) can help you set and achieve your observability goals for the new microservices architecture you're rolling out at XYZ Inc.
>
> Alice, as VP Engineering at XYZ Inc, we'll show you how you can increase your application uptime with the right observability goals. Bob, as an Engineering Manager on the platform team, we'll show you how easy it is to start instrumenting all of XYZ's microservices.
>
> What's a good time for you to chat?

- Don't copy this format or phrasing; instead use this email to show off how you can write effective emails.
- This example would demonstrate how you engage with a lead gathered by a colleague at a conference. Don't (necessarily) choose that scenario unless you actually have experience with it. Other possible examples include upselling freemium users, handling demo requests, cold outreach, etc.
- In your email, `Alice`, `Bob`, `Carol`, `ABC Corp`, `FooBar`, `XYZ Inc`, `VP Engineering`, and `Engineering Manager on the platform team` would all be actual names based on your choices for the mock scenario, not dummy placeholders.
- If we need more context in order to effectively impersonate the prospective customer and personas, we'll ask you.

We'll reply to this email (impersonating based on your choice) to set up a time with you for the mock call.

## The call

- From the moment we join the call, we will be *in character* impersonating the prospective customer and persona you've chosen.
  - If you need to call a time-out because we have a fundamental misunderstanding of who we're supposed to be impersonating, say "time out".
- When the mock call is done, say "debrief". We will all debrief (out of character) for 10 minutes. We will ask about why you made certain decisions.

You should send a mock follow-up email after the call (just as you would after a real call).

## What we're looking for

- A smart choice of the mock scenario. Choose one that you excel at and that gives us signal that you'd be successful at Sourcegraph.
- Good discovery, presentation, and next steps.
- Well-written email correspondence.
- Efficient scheduling and agenda-setting.
- Effective objection handling.
- Product knowledge (of the product you've chosen for the mock scenario, not Sourcegraph).
- Staying on time during the meeting.
