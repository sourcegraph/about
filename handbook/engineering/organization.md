# Organization

The purpose of our engineering organization is to build a product that is valuable to our customers.

To achieve this purpose, we need to ensure two things:

1. Each feature or product that we build needs to coherently solve a particular customer problem. {#customer-needs}
1. We make the necessary technology investments to maximize our velocity over time (e.g., building a standard component library, investing in automated testing). {#engineering-needs}

This document describes how we organize engineering to ensure that we are making progress on both dimensions.

## Philosophy

This section describes how we think about our team in its ideal state. Due to a variety of real-world constraints that change over time (e.g., hiring, product priorities, engineering priorities, skills of our current team), our organization might temporarily exist in a state that is inconsistent with these ideals from time to time. That is ok.

### Teams

We have mission based teams. This means that each team is responsible for a particular long term mission, which may be a [product concern](#customer-needs) or an [engineering concern](#engineering-needs). In either case, the team contains the necessary cross-functional skillsets to achieve that mission. Each team is lead by a [Project Lead](roles.md#project-lead).

### Management

[Engineering managers](roles.md#engineering-manager) are primarily responsible for the career development of the engineers who they manage. To best facilitate this goal, we prefer managers to focus on managing engineers of a particular skill set that the manager is familiar with. Managers are responsible for driving cross-team functional alignment to ensure that we are satisfying our [engineering needs](#engineering-needs) within the function that they manage.

This means that a manager can manage engineers across multiple teams. Each engineer only ever has one manager.
