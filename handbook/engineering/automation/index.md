## Automation project

Automation is a project that contains members from the [web team](../web/index.md) and [core services team](../core-services/index.md).

Vision statement: Developers can automate any large-scale code change across all code hosts, confidently manage campaigns with thousands of changesets, are proactively notified about campaigns they should run that would improve code quality, and consider the notifications high signal-to-noise.
