# Code insights team

The code insights team will be responsible for building and delivering code insights to engineering leaders, empowering data-driven decisions in engineering organizations.

## What is code insights?

Code insights is the first feature in Sourcegraph that can tell you things about your code at a **high level**. 

Code insights dashboards will answer questions like "How is a migration progressing?", "What areas of the code are most vulnerable to bugs?", and "How many developers are using a specific API?" Code insights will also incorporate third-party data like code coverage or static analysis metrics to deliver on the promise of aggregating everything you can know about your code. 

Sourcegraph is in the unique position to give these insights because we have universal code search: to know _anything_ about your code at a high level confidently means you must know _everything_ about your code at a low level.

Code insights connects many features that Sourcegraph already has and builds on top of them.
We go beyond single-step code intelligence and search to connect the full cycle of analyzing (code intelligence), monitoring (code insights), and actionably changing a codebase (campaigns).

Code insights is the first feature primarily built for non-search-based user personas (developers), instead focusing first on the needs of engineering directors and VPs.

## Goals and roadmap

[Goals and roadmap](goals.md)

The code insights team also keeps a [backlog GitHub project board](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/118). We use the backlog for tracking bugs, small features, and unplanned work. We don't use the backlog for tracking work that is expressly planned in our [roadmap](goals.md#roadmap). 

## We're hiring for this team!

We are building the code insights team by hiring [frontend engineers](../hiring/software-engineer-frontend.md) and [backend engineers](../hiring/software-engineer-backend.md). The engineering manager for this team will be [Felix Becker](../../../company/team/index.md#felix-becker) and the product manager will be [Joel Kwartler](../../../company/team/index.md#joel-kwartler-he-him).
New team members will initially contribute work towards code insights under the umbrella of the [web team](../web/index.md) and split off into their own independent team once we have enough team members.
