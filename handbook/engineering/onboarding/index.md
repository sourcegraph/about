# Engineering onboarding

Welcome! We're excited to have you join the team. This document outlines the structure of your first few weeks at Sourcegraph.

## Getting set up

You'll have to get some basics set up in your first few days:

- Complete [general onboarding](../../people-ops/onboarding/index.md#general-onboarding-checklist)
- [Configure your GitHub notifications.](../github-notifications/index.md)
- Join #dev-announce, #dev-chat, and your team's channel on Slack, as well as any other channels you find interesting. [Team chat documentation](../../communication/team_chat.md#engineering)
- Set up your [local development environment](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/main/doc/dev/getting-started/index.md). If you encounter any issues, ask for help in Slack and then update the documentation to reflect the resolution (so the next engineer that we hire doesn't run into the same problem).
- [Add Sourcegraph as a browser search engine](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/integration/browser_search_engine). Add another entry for our internal instance: `https://sourcegraph.sgdev.org/search?q=%s`. This also ensures you have access to our internal instance.
- Read through your team's handbook page, to learn about the team and its internal processes.
- Complete the onboarding for your role:
  - [Software engineer onboarding](software-engineer-onboarding.md)
  - [Engineering manager onboarding](engineering-manager-onboarding.md)

## Manager checklist

Your manager should complete the following steps when you join:

- Schedule a recurring [1-1](../../leadership/1-1.md).
- Grant access to necessary services.
  - [Sourcegraph organization on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/people)
    - Invite to relevant GitHub teams, including [@sourcegraph/everyone](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/teams/everyone).
  - [Sourcegraph organization on Sourcegraph.com](https://sourcegraph.com/organizations/sourcegraph/members)
  - [LSIF organization on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/lsif/people) (optional; recommended for Code Intelligence team members)
  - [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/organizations/sourcegraph/users/new)
  - Add the user to the `gcp-engineering` [group](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/groups?orgonly=true&project=&folder=&organizationId=1006954638239&supportedpurview=organizationId) so they have access to our [Google Cloud Platform](../environments.md).
  - [Opsgenie](https://sourcegraph.app.opsgenie.com/settings/users/)
  - [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/sourcegraph)
  - [Site24x7](https://www.site24x7.com) (optional; recommended for Distribution team members)

  - Ask Christina to send an invite to [Productboard](https://sourcegraph.productboard.com)
  - Ask a member of the Design team to invite as "Viewer" to [Figma](https://figma.com)
  - Ask on `dev-chat` for access to [Percy](https://percy.io/) which we use for visual testing.

## Give feedback on your onboarding

At the end of week 6 at Sourcegraph, your manager will send you a survey to learn more about what worked and what didn't during your onboarding. Take your time to answer this thoughtfully â€” your answers will be very important to make sure our onboarding process is even better for future hires!
