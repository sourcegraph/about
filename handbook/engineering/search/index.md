Our current goals are documented in the [search team's current tracking issue](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Atracking+label%3Ateam%2Fsearch).

## Growth plan

_Updated 2020-07-22_

We would like to grow this team to ~6-8 engineers and we expect the right split of skills to be roughly 50%/50% between [frontend](https://github.com/sourcegraph/careers/blob/master/job-descriptions/software-engineer-frontend.md) and [backend](https://github.com/sourcegraph/careers/blob/master/job-descriptions/software-engineer-backend.md). This growth is contingent upon having a dedicated engineering manager for this team.
