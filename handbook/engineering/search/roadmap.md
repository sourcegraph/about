#### 1. Enterprise homepage
- **Owner:** Farhan, Juliana
- **Status:** Completed
- **Estimated completion**: 3.21
         
#### 2. Search tour
- **Owner:** Farhan
- **Status:** Completed
- **Estimated completion**:
       - ~~3.20~~ 2020-09-22 update: not all bugs found during the initial round of user testing were fixed in 3.20
       - 3.21
       
#### 3. Search expressions
 - **Owner:** Rijnard
 - **Status:** In progress

#### 4. Scaling indexed text search to 500k repositories
   - **Plan:** Incrementally add repositories to Sourcegraph.com until searches get slow or start breaking. Fix those things. Then continue adding repositories.
   - **Owners:** Keegan/Stefan
   - **Status:** [In progress](perf.md)
   - **Estimated completion**: 3.23 (End of December 2020)

#### 5. Streaming search 
  - **Plan:** Streaming search
  - **Owners:** Keegan, Juliana
  - **Status:** In progress
  - **Estimated completion:**
    - ~~3.21~~ 2020-09-23 update: We revised this estimate after discussing needed work on the design & frontend side.
    - 3.22

#### 6. Code monitoring version 1
  - Code monitoring sends users notifications for new search results in channels outside of Sourcegraph.
  - Improve email notification support and expand the types of notification channels available.
  - **Plan**
    - Personal code monitors (no organization level monitors in v1)
    - Email and Webhooks Support
  - **Owner:** Juliana, Stefan
  - **Status:** Not started
  - **Estimated start:** 2020-11-02
  - **Estimated effort:** 4 weeks
  
#### 7. Performance at scale 
Follow-up to ‚Äúscale indexed text search to 500k repositories‚Äù, focus and scope TBD

#### 8. Consolidate repogroups + search scopes
As a user, I can create a scope of code I want to search across as a list of repositories
  - Consolidate the overlapping features for this experience - repogroups and search scope pages.
  - Scoping your search to multiple repositories is intuitive and easy ([issue](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/10621))

#### 9. Better version contexts 1/2
As a user, I can create a scope of code I want to search across as a list of repositories + branches
  - Creating version context scopes manually is time consuming. Improve this user experience ([issue](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/11569))
  - ToDo: consolidate user requests for a better search experience with version contexts set

#### 10. Search language rules engine
  - **Owner:** Rijnard
  - **Status:** In progress
  - **Plan**
      - Implement a query language extension to express relations (i.e., rules) on code, files, repositories, and commits. This replaces awkward one-off filters like `repohasfile`, `repohascommitafter` that do not generalize.
      - Prototype semantic search functionality that combines text search and LSIF data
      - Implement quality-of-life features for search: syntax highlighting, multiline queries, improve structural search performance
  - **Owner:** Rijnard/Stefan
  - **Status:** Not started
  - **Estimated start:** 3.21
  - **Estimated effort:** 4 months
  
#### 11. Saved searches without monitoring
  - Save or bookmark a search query you want to run again.
  - Save a "composable query" or a query that can added on to the existing search query entered (i.e., improve [search scopes](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search/how-to/scopes)).
  
#### 12. Search results redesign
  - Search Tabs 
  - Search results with sidebar
  - Design refresh
  - and more. scope TBD
  
#### 13. Diff/commit search performance
  - Diff/commit search performance works beyond the 50 repository limit ([issue](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/6826)).
  - Support security use cases which require searching over code history, specifically commits and diffs.
  
#### 14. Search input redesign
  - Reduce business in the search bar
  - Search Expressions are supported
  - and more. scope TBD

#### 15. Structural search performance
  - Structural search is a good experience for larger-scale code bases and cloud users.
  - Structural search supports security use cases that require returning exhaustive search results, i.e., every result from the entire set of code they care about.

#### 16. Better version contexts 2/2
As a user, I can create a scope of code I want to search across as a list of repositories + branches that should be indexed
  - Improve the speed for unindexed code (e.g. diffs, commits) in the version context scopes they want to search over.

#### 17. Code monitoring version 2
  - Code monitoring sends users notifications for new search results in channels outside of Sourcegraph.
  - Plan below should be updated based on learnings from user testing code monitoring version 1.
  - **Plan**
    - Organization level code monitors
                
#### 18. Semantic search: prototype validation
  - Referencing precise code intelligence (e.g. usages, definition) in search
  - **Plan**
    - Build a prototype to validate the idea
  
#### 19. External search result providers
  - Ability to search over data from issue trackers, internal tools, etc.
  - The first set of providers is likely Sourcegraph [extensions](https://sourcegraph.com/extensions)
  
#### 20. Semantic search: implementation
  - Referencing precise code intelligence (e.g. usages, definition) in search
