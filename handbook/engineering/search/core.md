## Support rotation

The Search Core team has a customer support rotation: each week, one team member will be responsible for fielding questions and requests from Customer Engineering and Customer Support.

The engineer on support rotation can be contacted using the Slack alias `@search-core-support`.

The support rotation can be viewed on Opsgenie: [search core schedule](https://sourcegraph.app.opsgenie.com/teams/dashboard/1cc52380-1d71-420e-9c80-2ccb161c648c/main).

Should an engineer be unable to fulfill support responsibilities for any reason (for example, due to upcoming time off), they should swap with a teammate.

## Iterations

The search core team plans its work in **2-week iterations**.

**Team syncs, plans and updates:**

- The teams holds syncs thrice weekly (M, W, F).
- Before team syncs, teammates add their status and plans to the [team sync meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cTdGC4jBK7aEnb9ChzCLYHVGBpRRMNYGdUUPYVPIWHo/edit#).
- The team discusses the updates live during the sync.
- Updates should be in prose and communicate progress made and pain points.

### Planning an iteration

Iterations start **every other Monday**.

**On the last Friday of an iteration:**

- The team holds its [retrospective](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bzBJh-zPOw0_lZ-TbMpnAx-do5CoCTL8Z2V74WU-Rew/edit) for the previous iteration.

**On the first Monday of an iteration:**

- The team reviews the iteration plan during the team sync, and kicks off the iteration.
