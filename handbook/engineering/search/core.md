## Iterations

The search core team plans its work in **2-week iterations**.

The goals and updates for current and past iterations can be found in the [iteration log](./iteration_log.md).

### Planning an iteration

Iterations start **every other Monday**.

**On the last Friday of an iteration:**

- Teammates add the themes they're planning to work on, and the desired outcomes, to the [iteration log](./iteration_log.md).
- Teammates add any topics they would like to discuss during the retrospective to the [Search core team retrospectives](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bzBJh-zPOw0_lZ-TbMpnAx-do5CoCTL8Z2V74WU-Rew/edit) document.

**On the first Monday of an iteration:**

- The team holds its [retrospective](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bzBJh-zPOw0_lZ-TbMpnAx-do5CoCTL8Z2V74WU-Rew/edit) for the previous iteration.
- The team reviews the iteration plan during the team sync, and kicks off the iteration.

**Work log updates:**

- Teammates should update the [work log](./iteration_log.md) for the themes they're working on.
- PR approvals are not required for work log updates.
- Updates should be in prose and communicate progress made and pain points.
- Updates should happen at least twice (in the middle and at the end of the iteration), but may be more frequent if desired.
  - The mid-iteration update should contain a forecast for the next week, and whether the remaining planned work is on track to be completed on time.
  - The end-of-iteration update should mention whether the planned outcomes were reached or not, and if not, why.
