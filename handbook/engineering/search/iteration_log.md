### Scale indexed search to 500k repositories

- **Owner(s):** Stefan, Keegan
- **Outcomes:**
    - Zoekt is called before we resolve repositories in global search. The outcome of this is a faster global search.
    - Improved tracing for indexed search.
- **Work log:**
    - 2020-09-25: Important parts of the code path had not been instrumented with tracing. To pinpoint the performance issue, we added tracing to `newIndexSearchRequest` [#13949](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/13949) and the RPC layer [#13951](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/13951). Based on the improved tracing, we chose to focus our efforts on global queries first, IE queries without `repo:` or `file:` filters. Traces of global queries show that we spend a significant amount of time (O(#indexed repos)) on assembling, splitting, and serializing lists of repo revisions. With [#14093](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/14093) we resolve repositories and query zoekt concurrently (limited to global, literal content searches). We plan to measure the impact of [#14093](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/14093) with help of selected traces and search-blitz.

### Streaming search

- **Owner(s):** Keegan, Juliana
- **Outcomes:**
    - Make a decision on whether to integrate with existing search results components or write a new set of components to show streamed results.
    - Identify which metatada we want to display while streaming results, and define corresponding API contract.
    - Define experience for large result sets (how many results are displayed initially, "show more" versus infinite scrolling).
    - Define experience for dynamic filters.
    - We have a project board representing remaining design + implementation work for future iterations.
- **Work log:**
    - 2020-09-25: Exploratory work has been made to understand how the search results page currently works and how the streaming search POC has been built. [Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ApXqBr9tasltKPvV9KHp64VzPekH5vCKOcAWz6Am6Ng/edit#heading=h.q8u68shhkq3i)

### Enterprise homepage

- **Owner(s):** Juliana, Farhan
- **Outcomes:**
    - The feedback resulting from [design QA](https://www.figma.com/file/sPRyyv3nt5h0284nqEuAXE/%2312192-Sourcegraph-server-page-v1?node-id=2274%3A21539) has been implemented.
    - The feature has been QA'd internally.
    - If all feedback resulting from internal QA can be integrated during the iteration, the feature flag is turned on by default so that server users see it in 3.21.
    - Metrics collection will be reviewed
    - Survey is sent to internal users to gauge the response
- **Work log:**
    - 2020-09-25: Feedback from design QA has been implemented and merged. Telemetry logging has been added. This feature is now also available for Sourcegraph.com behind a feature flag.

### Search tour

- **Owner(s):** Farhan
- **Outcomes:**
    - The [feedback from the first round of user testing](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/13944) has been implemented.
    - The design team is able to run subsequent rounds of user testing for feedback.
    - If user testing is completed, and feedback is addressed, the tour is turned on for all Sourcegraph.com new users by default.
    - Metrics logging is reviewed and approved by @ebrodymoore and @rrhyne.
- **Work log:**
    - 2020-09-25: Fixes for the first round of user testing have been implemented in a [PR](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pulls/attfarhan), approved by @limitedmage and awaiting review from @rrhyne and @lguychard. Metrics have been reviewed and approved by @ebrodymoore and rrhyne.

### Search expressions

- **Owner(s):** Rijnard
- **Outcomes:**
    - Make search expressions available under feature flag (merge WIP PR) 
- **Work log:**
    - 2020-09-25: Not working on this this week. Next week.

### Blog post: Turning code search into on-demand lightweight analysis

- **Owner(s):** Rijnard
- **Outcomes:**
    - Raise visibility on the topic/capability of code search as lightweight analysis. Inform relevant customer contacts about these capabilities.
- **Work log:**
    - 2020-09-25: Want to get the multiline search query page onto Sourcegraph.com for the blog post, so I worked on that a bit. It doesn't have to be perfect, but it can't be a mess either, so I've been working on polishing up the [PR#14147](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/14147). Debugged/fixed a major regression affecting repogroups, a setback for progress on this blog post. Also got sidetracked by an important customer issue about large files not being indexed, and debugged/reproduced the issue to help next steps. Will continue with this work item next week, should be ok to get things done in time.
    
### Code Monitoring
- **Owner(s):** Juliana
- **Outcomes:**
    - Work with product and design to understand the scope of the work. Based on this, start work on a dev implementation plan.
- **Work log:**
    - 2020-09-25: Initial meeting took place between Pooja, Quinn Keast and Juliana to understand the scope of the work. [Meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EG42dM1old49uPXpGAqL7b9k95bWpM0Zcu0JM5gXtOQ/edit?ts=5f6dac2c)
