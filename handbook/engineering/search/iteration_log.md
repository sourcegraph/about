### Scaling

- **Owner(s):** Stefan
- **Outcomes:**
    - Validate Solr as possible search backend.
- **Work log:**
    - 2021-04-23: Built a (CLI) prototype for code search based on a Solr backend. We could validate that it is feasable to support regexp search. The next question is to find out how Solr performs under realistic conditions and to compare the performance against zoekt.

### Ranking

- **Owner(s):** Ryan

    - 2021-04-09: RFC 359 released & reviewed
    - Implement Github popularity ranking for open source search.
      - 2021-04-09: modified repoupdater and zoekt indexservers to compute the popularity of each repo and store it as part of each shardâ€™s metadata.

### Exhaustive Search

- **Owner(s):** Keegan, Stefan
- **Outcomes:**
    - Ready for external use.
- **Work log:**
    - 2021-04-09: Descoped to remove result count work. Zoekt scheduler landed and tested. `count:all` landed. Next week we will do polish work, testing and documentation for exhaustive search.
    - 2021-04-16: Lots of testing and polish work. Documentation also shipped. I regard this as ready for external use. May need some time to respond to internal testing next week.
