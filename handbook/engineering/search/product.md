## Processes

### Planning

We work in two-week iterations.

Iterations start every other Monday.

On the last Thursday of an iteration:

- The EM for the team:
    - Creates a GitHub project for the iteration.
    - Creates a section in the [planning document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1swnkQwd724IB_HP3_Mw3KkFnfl45t-PmWcNo_1gtkQM/edit#), outlining a draft of current projects / priorities.
- The team:
    - Adds notes to the planning document outlining how they plan to contribute to current projects / priorities, adds any missing projects / priorities, adds any questions on missing context.
    - Adds relevant issues to the GitHub project for the iteration, based on the content of the planning document.

We have asynchronous discussion in the planning document. On the first Monday of an iteration, during the team sync, we validate the current plan & the contents of the GitHub project together, thus officially starting the iteration.

We keep our iteration process fluid. We discuss any aspects that could be improved in our retrospective, and aggressively bias towards testing out new changes immediately.

### Retrospectives

At the end of every iteration, we conduct a retrospective. Our retrospective notes can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15F7OXwFTpLIvjPrJtNd0wRY49MtCUO-kMacpcIMlAWU/edit).
