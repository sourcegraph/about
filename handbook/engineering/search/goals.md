# Search goals and priorities

## Goals

Goals help us achieve our [vision](index.md#vision) for search.

### Mature query language

**Problem:** The Sourcegraph query language does not support the growing complexity of searches being run by our users.

Examples:

- I want to only show examples from repositories that have been modified in the last 3 months so I see the most recent solutions.
- I want to find repositories that have not been modified in over a year so I can deprecate them.
- TODO: add more examples.

**Success criteria**

TODO table of use cases / capabilities we want to achieve, comparing Sourcegraph with other search tools

**Planned work**

1. Search expressions
1. Search language rules engine

### Users trust Sourcegraph for fast and reliable search results at scale

**Problem:** Search is too slow or frequently times out at the scale some of our customers care about, and at the scale we want Sourcegraph Cloud to reach. In large-scale codebases, running the same search several times yields varying result counts, with no insights into the underlying reasons. Customers cannot trust that their codebase was exhaustively searched.

**Success criteria**

- **By EOY 2020**: Latency for the set of search queries run by search-blitz is less than TODO Nms with 500k repositories indexed on Sourcegraph Cloud
    - 2020-11-05: TODO
- **By EOY 2020**: P99 time to first result is less than TODO Nms across all search types on Sourcegraph Cloud
    - 2020-11-05: TODO


**Planned work**

1. Scale indexed text search to 500k repositories
1. Streaming search

### Sourcegraph proactively notifies of important code changes

**Problem:** Customers want to be notified about important changes in their codebase. Our saved searches feature fails to address their desired use cases, so they have been building workarounds themselves. Saved searches are limited to email notifications, where webhooks would allow Sourcegraph notifications to reach a wider audience at customer orgs. TODO customer examples.

**Success criteria**

- **By TODO timeline**: TODO N customers are using code monitors
    - 2020-11-05: 0 customers are using code monitors

**Planned work**

1. Code monitoring (private code monitors, no sharing, emails + webhooks)

## Roadmap details

### 1. Enterprise homepage

- **Owner:** Farhan, Juliana
- **Status:** Completed
- **Estimated completion**: 3.21

### 2. Search tour

- **Owner:** Farhan
- **Status:** Completed
- **Estimated completion**:
       - ~~3.20~~ 2020-09-22 update: not all bugs found during the initial round of user testing were fixed in 3.20
       - 3.21

### 3. Search expressions

- **Owner:** Rijnard
- **Status:** In progress

### 4. Scale indexed text search to 500k repositories

- **Plan:** Incrementally add repositories to Sourcegraph.com until searches get slow or start breaking. Fix those things. Then continue adding repositories.
- **Owners:** Keegan/Stefan
- **Status:** [In progress](perf.md)
- **Estimated completion**: 3.23 (End of December 2020)

### 5. Streaming search

- **Plan:** Streaming search
- **Owners:** Keegan, Juliana
- **Status:** In progress
- **Estimated completion:**
  - ~~3.21~~ 2020-09-23 update: We revised this estimate after discussing needed work on the design & frontend side.
  - 3.22

### 6. Code monitoring version 1

- Code monitoring sends users notifications for new search results in channels outside of Sourcegraph.
- Improve email notification support and expand the types of notification channels available.
- **Plan**
  - Personal code monitors (no organization level monitors in v1)
  - Email and Webhooks Support
- **Owner:** Juliana, Stefan
- **Status:** Not started
- **Estimated start:** 2020-11-02
- **Estimated effort:** 4 weeks
  
### 7. Performance at scale

Follow-up to ‚Äúscale indexed text search to 500k repositories‚Äù, focus and scope TBD

### 8. Consolidate repogroups + search scopes

As a user, I can create a scope of code I want to search across as a list of repositories

- Consolidate the overlapping features for this experience - repogroups and search scope pages.
- Scoping your search to multiple repositories is intuitive and easy ([issue](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/10621))

### 9. Better version contexts 1/2

As a user, I can create a scope of code I want to search across as a list of repositories + branches

- Creating version context scopes manually is time consuming. Improve this user experience ([issue](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/11569))
- ToDo: consolidate user requests for a better search experience with version contexts set

### 10. Search language rules engine

- **Owner:** Rijnard
- **Status:** In progress
- **Plan**
  - Implement a query language extension to express relations (i.e., rules) on code, files, repositories, and commits. This replaces awkward one-off filters like `repohasfile`, `repohascommitafter` that do not generalize.
  - Prototype semantic search functionality that combines text search and LSIF data
  - Implement quality-of-life features for search: syntax highlighting, multiline queries, improve structural search performance
- **Owner:** Rijnard/Stefan
- **Status:** Not started
- **Estimated start:** 3.21
- **Estimated effort:** 4 months
  
### 11. Saved searches without monitoring

- Save or bookmark a search query you want to run again.
- Save a "composable query" or a query that can added on to the existing search query entered (i.e., improve [search scopes](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search/how-to/scopes)).
  
### 12. Search results redesign

- Search Tabs
- Search results with sidebar
- Design refresh
- and more. scope TBD
  
### 13. Diff/commit search performance

- Diff/commit search performance works beyond the 50 repository limit ([issue](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/6826)).
- Support security use cases which require searching over code history, specifically commits and diffs.
  
### 14. Search input redesign

- Reduce business in the search bar
- Search Expressions are supported
- and more. scope TBD

### 15. Structural search performance

- Structural search is a good experience for larger-scale code bases and cloud users.
- Structural search supports security use cases that require returning exhaustive search results, i.e., every result from the entire set of code they care about.

### 16. Better version contexts 2/2

As a user, I can create a scope of code I want to search across as a list of repositories + branches that should be indexed

- Improve the speed for unindexed code (e.g. diffs, commits) in the version context scopes they want to search over.

### 17. Code monitoring version 2

- Code monitoring sends users notifications for new search results in channels outside of Sourcegraph.
- Plan below should be updated based on learnings from user testing code monitoring version 1.
- **Plan**
  - Organization level code monitors

### 18. Semantic search: prototype validation

- Referencing precise code intelligence (e.g. usages, definition) in search
- **Plan**
  - Build a prototype to validate the idea
  
### 19. External search result providers

- Ability to search over data from issue trackers, internal tools, etc.
- The first set of providers is likely Sourcegraph [extensions](https://sourcegraph.com/extensions)
  
### 20. Semantic search: implementation

- Referencing precise code intelligence (e.g. usages, definition) in search
