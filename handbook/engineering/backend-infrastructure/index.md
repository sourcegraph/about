# Backend infrastructure team

**The backend infrastructure team does not yet exist**. It is a team we want to create & grow. The responsibilities of the backend infrastructure team are currently owned by the [Cloud team](../cloud/index.md).

## Vision

Make it easy for teammates of different experience levels to onboard and contribute to Sourcegraph backend code. Hide and remove non essential complexity from engineers working on new product features and use cases. Promote and champion consistency and simplicity across all backend code by building shared tools, libraries and infrastructure for common use cases. Scale and maintain said infrastructure. Create leverage for and accelerate other teams.

## Areas of ownership

Currently owned by the [Cloud team](../cloud/index.md#areas-of-ownership).
