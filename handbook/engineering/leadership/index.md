## Goals

Our long term vision is to build an organization that attracts and retains the best teammates from around the world, and that consistently delivers a high quality product to our customers.

When a goal is "done", move it to our [work log](worklog.md)

### Publicly documented compensation bands

**Problem:** When we were smaller, it was easy to contain consistent compensation across the entire team because there were fewer people to coordinate with. Now that we are bigger and have more engineering managers making offers and compensation decisions, we need to have clearly documented compensation bands so we can maintain consistency while federating decision making. We want to make this public because it will help candidates understand what they can expect before they even apply. This is a better candidate experience and it avoids rare but real situations where a candidate goes through our interview process only to discover that their compensation expectations don't fit into our bands.

**Milestones:**

1. ✅ Update our benchmark data and set bands to be shared with engineering managers internally to help them make offers and review/adjust compensation for their teams. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ywMdWxL8jCpGRXvEIY-bCVD4d4OZNRvz6-Gn4Spg4XU/edit#gid=292189111
1. Create more useful definitions for the expectations associated with each level of compensation.
1. Update the [compensation documentation in our handbook](../../people-ops/compensation.md#ranges) so candidates and current teammates know what our bands are.

## Communication

### Slack

- #eng-manager-team is a public channel where engineering managers can discuss work as a [first team](https://lethain.com/first-team/).
- #leadership-chat is a public channel (not specific to engineering) where anyone can discuss and share information of general interest to leadership at Sourcegraph.

### Meetings

We have a 1hr sync every Monday at 9:30am PT.

- This meeting is recorded and automatically posted to #eng-manager-team.
- Our [meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nZTGua3cdMTJLwANlBZNX2uXiDXLuYDBkH9tehwdqTY/edit#) are also internally available to the whole team.

### Weekly updates

The goal of these weekly updates is to communicate each team's progress and tie that progress to larger company goals.

Engineering managers send an update to [engineering-team-status@sourcegraph.com](https://groups.google.com/a/sourcegraph.com/g/engineering-team-status) every Friday by 1PM [PT](https://time.is/PT), or at EOD Thursday if you don't work on Friday. Delegate to someone else on your team to send the update when you are on vacation.

Anyone at the company can join the group to subscribe to these updates, but your primary audience is your manager (VP Eng and VP Product) and your peers (EMs/PMs). You can also cc your own team.

Please include the following content in your update:

- The subject of the email should contain the team name and the date the update is being sent (e.g. "Search update 2020-10-14") so each weekly update starts a distinct email thread (otherwise they get grouped together in the Google Groups UI).
- Write one sentence that highlights one important thing (for example: changes in important metrics, customer feedback collected, things shipped) the team made progress on this week and include a image/screenshot when possible.
  - The sentence should articulate what specifically was completed and why it was important.
    - Processes like planning, retrospectives, offsites, hiring, and post-mortems are important and valuable ingredients to generating progress over time, but are not themselves progress, so shouldn't be highlighted here.
    - This progress should be framed in a way that is understandable by anyone at the company.
  - Great highlights will be presented at company meeting by the VP of Eng or VP of Product.
    - It is helpful if screenshots are somewhere between squarish or 4:3. Very wide screenshots will not scale well on a slide.
    - If you can, include a link to where you took a screenshot so we can retake the screenshot at a different display ratio if necessary.
- Answer the following questions for each goal that your team is working on:
  - What important things happened this week (for example: changes in important metrics, customer feedback collected, things shipped)?
  - What are the plans for next week?
  - What should my peer-team and manager be aware of?

Good examples:

## Book recommendations

Here are some books that multiple people on the team have read and recommend. If you haven't read these, [use your education budget](../../people-ops/travel.md#professional-development-and-education) and read them!

- [Turn the Ship Around](https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers/dp/1591846404/) - An inspiring story of how Navy captain David Marquet turned the lowest performing submarine in the Navy into the top performing one with his bottom's up leadership style.
- [Orbiting the Giant Hairball](https://www.amazon.com/Orbiting-Giant-Hairball-Corporate-Surviving/dp/0670879835/) - An entertaining self-account of Gordon MacKenzie's experience fostering creativity on his team at Hallmark Cards. Buy the hard copy. There are lots of fun illustrations and short stories. It is a quick read and probably unlike any other book you have read.
- [Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/the-book/) - How to be a great leader by caring personally and challenging directly.
- [An Elegant Puzzle](https://lethain.com/elegant-puzzle/) - A field manual on how to do engineering management. Reads like a well structured markdown file.
- [The Five Dysfunctions of a Team](https://www.amazon.com/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Fable/dp/0787960756) - A model of how to think about what makes a highly effective team paired with a fictional story that illustrates the model.
