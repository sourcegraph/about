## Goals

Our long term vision is to build an organization that attracts and retains the best teammates from around the world, and that consistently delivers a high quality product to our customers.

When a goal is "done", move it to our [work log](worklog.md)

### Short term (~1-2 months)

#### Engineering team goals

- Problem: [We decided to change how we think about goals](https://github.com/sourcegraph/about/pull/1177).
- Plan: Since we are no longer doing OKRs, we need each team to create an initial set of [goals](../../../company/goals.md) to communicate what they are working on and why. This is done when each team has documented an initial set of goals that Nick and Christina approve.
- Owner: Each EM owns this for their own team and should communicate the status of the goal setting process for their team in the handbook itself.
- Status: [In progress](../../../company/goals.md#engineering).

#### Engineering manager onboarding

- Problem: We recently hired and onboarded our first group of engineering managers and onboarded each of them in an ad hoc way. We will be hiring at least one more engineering manager in the near future (for the web team) and we want to document what we have learned so they have an even better onboarding experience.
- Owner: Nick
- Plan: Document the onboarding process for engineering managers in our handbook before the EM for the web team starts.
- Status: Not started.

### Medium term (~3-6 months)

#### Publicly documented compensation bands

- Problem: When we were smaller, it was easy to contain consistent compensation across the entire team because there were fewer people to coordinate with. Now that we are bigger and have more engineering managers making offers and compensation decisions, we need to have clearly documented compensation bands so we can maintain consistency while federating decision making. We want to make this public because it will help candidates understand what they can expect before they even apply. This is a better candidate experience and it avoids rare but real situations where a candidate goes through our interview process only to discover that their compensation expectations don't fit into our bands.
- Owner: Nick
- Plan:
  1. Update our benchmark data and set bands to be shared with engineering managers internally to help them make offers and review/adjust compensation for their teams.
  2. Update the [compensation documentation in our handbook](../../people-ops/compensation.md#ranges) so candidates and current teammates know what our bands are.
- Status: [First milestone is in progress](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iQsfchsnY5CxKSZfcnazpnJ1uSL6-gMuEI-wgsfLq3I/edit#gid=1795648823).

#### Publicly documented interview modules

- Problem: Any candidate who has interviewed at multiple companies knows that interview processes are hit or miss. We have spent time and effort to ensure that we have a great interview process, and candidates regularly tell us that we do after going through it. Right now, candidates don't know what to expect out of our interview process beyond the title of each interview module and a brief description.
- Plan: We want candidates to know up front as much as possible about each interview, including exact questions that we will be asking them and how we will be evaluating their answers (as much as possible). Sharing this information would have many benefits:
  - It shows candidates that our process is reasonable, fair, and challenging.
  - It allows candidates to prepare and present their best selves.
  - It forces us to think of better interview questions that are [unhackable](http://www.paulgraham.com/lesson.html).
  - It makes our interview process more accessible to candidates who would be disadvantaged in a live interview (for example, people with hearing or speech disabilities) because it would be easy to accept written answers to our documented questions.
- Owner: TBD.
- Status: Not started. Needs more discussion.

## Communication

### Slack

- #leadership-chat is a public channel (not specific to this team or engineering) where anyone can discuss and share information of general interest to leadership at Sourcegraph.
- #eng-leadership-team is a private channel for members of this team to discuss sensitive topics, or topics that would be noise to people outside of the team. For anything else, prefer to use #leadership-chat.

### Meetings

We have a 1hr sync with product and engineering every Tuesday at 9am PT ([meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10fEh3Cw0ENKjFYDP-4OoLZbOZTVAtMpifc2WM_1mGVU/edit)).

### Weekly updates

Engineering managers send an update to [engineering-leadership-status@sourcegraph.com](https://groups.google.com/a/sourcegraph.com/g/engineering-leadership-status) on either Monday or Tuesday each week (suggestion: send after your weekly team meeting). Anyone at the company can join the group to subscribe to these updates. The purpose of the update is to keep interested parties (including the VP of Engineering, and peer managers) informed of what is going on in each part of our organization. The format of this update is at the discretion of the sender, but it should be prose that generally answers the following questions:

- What important things happened last week?
  - Include contact with customers (feedback collected, things shipped).
- What are the plans for this week?
  - Include contact with customers (feedback collected, things shipped).
- What should my peer-team/manager be aware of?

If you have sensitive information to communicate, please send a separate email directly to the relevant people.

## Book recommendations

Here are some books that multiple people on the team have read and recommend. If you haven't read these, [use your education budget](../../people-ops/travel.md#professional-development-and-education) and read them!

- [Turn the Ship Around](https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers/dp/1591846404/) - An inspiring story of how Navy captain David Marquet turned the lowest performing submarine in the Navy into the top performing one with his bottom's up leadership style.
- [Orbiting the Giant Hairball](https://www.amazon.com/Orbiting-Giant-Hairball-Corporate-Surviving/dp/0670879835/) - An entertaining self-account of Gordon MacKenzie's experience fostering creativity on his team at Hallmark Cards. Buy the hard copy. There are lots of fun illustrations and short stories. It is a quick read and probably unlike any other book you have read.
- [Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/the-book/) - How to be a great leader by caring personally and challenging directly.
- [An Elegant Puzzle](https://lethain.com/elegant-puzzle/) - A field manual on how to do engineering management. Reads like a well structured markdown file.
- [The Five Dysfunctions of a Team](https://www.amazon.com/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Fable/dp/0787960756) - A model of how to think about what makes a highly effective team paired with a fictional story that illustrates the model.
