## Goals

Our long term vision is to build an organization that attracts and retains the best teammates from around the world, and that consistently delivers a high quality product to our customers.

When a goal is "done", move it to our [work log](worklog.md)

#### Publicly documented compensation bands

- Problem: When we were smaller, it was easy to contain consistent compensation across the entire team because there were fewer people to coordinate with. Now that we are bigger and have more engineering managers making offers and compensation decisions, we need to have clearly documented compensation bands so we can maintain consistency while federating decision making. We want to make this public because it will help candidates understand what they can expect before they even apply. This is a better candidate experience and it avoids rare but real situations where a candidate goes through our interview process only to discover that their compensation expectations don't fit into our bands.
- Owner: Nick
- Plan:
  1. Update our benchmark data and set bands to be shared with engineering managers internally to help them make offers and review/adjust compensation for their teams. WIP: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ywMdWxL8jCpGRXvEIY-bCVD4d4OZNRvz6-Gn4Spg4XU/edit#gid=292189111
  2. Update the [compensation documentation in our handbook](../../people-ops/compensation.md#ranges) so candidates and current teammates know what our bands are.

## Communication

### Slack

- #leadership-chat is a public channel (not specific to this team or engineering) where anyone can discuss and share information of general interest to leadership at Sourcegraph.

### Meetings

We have a 1hr sync with product and engineering every Monday at 9:30am PT ([meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10fEh3Cw0ENKjFYDP-4OoLZbOZTVAtMpifc2WM_1mGVU/edit)).

### Weekly updates

Engineering managers send an update to [engineering-leadership-status@sourcegraph.com](https://groups.google.com/a/sourcegraph.com/g/engineering-leadership-status) on either Monday or Tuesday each week (suggestion: send after your weekly team meeting). Anyone at the company can join the group to subscribe to these updates. The purpose of the update is to keep interested parties (including the VP of Engineering, and peer managers) informed of what is going on in each part of our organization. The format of this update is at the discretion of the sender, but it should be prose that generally answers the following questions:

- What important things happened last week?
  - Include contact with customers (feedback collected, things shipped).
- What are the plans for this week?
  - Include contact with customers (feedback collected, things shipped).
- What should my peer-team/manager be aware of?

If you have sensitive information to communicate, please send a separate email directly to the relevant people.

The subject of the email should contain the date the update is being sent (e.g. "Search update 2020-10-14") so each weekly update starts a distinct thread (otherwise they get grouped together in the Google Groups UI).

## Book recommendations

Here are some books that multiple people on the team have read and recommend. If you haven't read these, [use your education budget](../../people-ops/travel.md#professional-development-and-education) and read them!

- [Turn the Ship Around](https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers/dp/1591846404/) - An inspiring story of how Navy captain David Marquet turned the lowest performing submarine in the Navy into the top performing one with his bottom's up leadership style.
- [Orbiting the Giant Hairball](https://www.amazon.com/Orbiting-Giant-Hairball-Corporate-Surviving/dp/0670879835/) - An entertaining self-account of Gordon MacKenzie's experience fostering creativity on his team at Hallmark Cards. Buy the hard copy. There are lots of fun illustrations and short stories. It is a quick read and probably unlike any other book you have read.
- [Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/the-book/) - How to be a great leader by caring personally and challenging directly.
- [An Elegant Puzzle](https://lethain.com/elegant-puzzle/) - A field manual on how to do engineering management. Reads like a well structured markdown file.
- [The Five Dysfunctions of a Team](https://www.amazon.com/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Fable/dp/0787960756) - A model of how to think about what makes a highly effective team paired with a fictional story that illustrates the model.
