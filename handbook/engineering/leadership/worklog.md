### Career guidance for engineering roles at Sourcegraph

### Fullstack engineer role

- Problem: Cloud and Code Intelligence teams have a mix of frontend and backend work, but current workload is skewed toward the latter. It doesn't make sense to hire a single frontend dev because they would end up working alone and there might not be enough work to sustain a full time frontend dev.
- Owners: Tom√°s, Aida
- Solution: We defined a full stack engineer role.
