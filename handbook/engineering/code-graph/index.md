# Code Graph engineering org

The Code Graph org's mission is to build the **code graph**.
Each team within our org implements a different _verb_ on the code graph:

- The [Search teams](./search/index.md) enable _searching_ the code graph
  - [Search Core team](./search/core.md)
  - [Search Product team](./search/product.md)
- The [Code Intelligence team](./code-intelligence/index.md) enables _navigating_ and _inspecting_ the code graph
- The [Code Insights team](./code-insights/index.md) enables _measuring_ and _tracking_ the code graph
- The [Batch Changes team](./batch-changes/index.md) enables _changing_ the code graph
