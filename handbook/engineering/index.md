## Teams

Each Sourcegraph engineer works on a team that has long-term ownership of a part of our product and codebase. See the [project roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cBsE9801DcBF9chZyMnxRdolqM_1c2pPyGQz15QAvYI/edit#) for what each team is working on.

## Misc.

This point lives here for now:

- We require passing checks on GitHub PRs before merging (and don't allow direct pushes to master). Sometimes it's nice to push without waiting for checks (such as for docs-only changes), but this is outweighed by the downside that people too often accidentally merged changes that broke the build. Certain kinds of low risk changes (e.g., documentation only changes) may only run a subset of the build pipeline so that checks pass quickly in those cases.
