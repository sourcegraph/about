# Testing

This file documents how we test code at Sourcegraph.


## Percy

We use [Percy](https://percy.io/) to detect visual changes in Sourcegraph features. You may need permissions to update screenshots if your feature introduces visual changes. Post a message in #dev-chat that you need access to Percy, and someone will add you to our organization (you will also receive an invitation via e-mail). Make sure you are logged in with your GitHub credentials.
