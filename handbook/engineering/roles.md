# Roles on the Engineering team

This page lists the roles and responsibilities of the Engineering team.

## Software Engineer

### Responsibilities

- Write (the first pass) or update the documentation for features you create or change.
- TODO

### Tech Lead

<!-- TODO(nicksnyder): this was taken from the old docs -->

A Software Engineer who is a Tech Lead has the following additional responsibilities.

The Tech Lead is responsible for making sure the following two statements are true:

> The issues for the current release milestone describe the problem/solution.
>
> The issues for the current release milestone are completed (closed) before the release.

The following sections give more details.

#### The issues for each release milestone are completed (closed) before the release.

This means the tech lead needs to do 2 things:

- **Estimate** at planning time what can get done in the time alotted for a release milestone.
- **Reschedule** issues continuously into/from the milestone depending on the pace and triage

It's impossible to estimate perfectly, so the tech lead needs to continuously monitor the team's progress and make adjustments accordingly.

If it looks like the team won't be able to complete all planned issues by the release date, the tech lead **must** communicate this in the #product channel and follow up with a combination of:

- helping unblock or accelerate the work of individual teammates
- descoping issues in this milestone
- deferring issues to a later milestone
- getting help from other people on certain issues

The [Product Manager](../product/roles.md#product-manager) can help here, especially with product and priority questions for descoping or deferring work.

#### The issues for each release milestone describe the problem/solution.

This means the tech lead needs to do 2 things:

- Ensure the issues for feature work have enough information for the devs who are implementing the feature.
- Gather information for bug reports (including documenting/automating how other people can supply the info needed to diagnose/fix the bug).
