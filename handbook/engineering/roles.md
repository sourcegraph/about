# Roles on the Engineering team

This page lists the roles on the Engineering team and some of the responsibilities for each of the roles.

## Software Engineer

Software Engineers are individual contributors who build software to satisfy the needs of the business.

### Responsibilities

- Collaborate with your direct manager to identify projects that align your skills and interests with the needs of the business.
- Write [RFCs](../communication/rfcs/index.md) to recommend solutions to product and engineering problems.
- Commit to a reasonable amount of work that you are going to get done for each [monthly release](releases/index.md), and then reliably get it done.
- Create and maintain high quality code, tests, and documentation.
- Help your teammates by empathetically [reviewing code](code_reviews.md) and [RFCs](../communication/rfcs/index.md).
- Interview candidates and suggest improvements to our hiring process.

## Project Lead

Project Leads are Software Engineers that lead a specific project team to achieve its goals. They are torch carriers that champion a project. This role is an additional set of responsibilities that any engineer may take on once they demonstrate the necessary skills.

While Project Leads need to have strong technical skills, they are not necessarily the most technically experienced engineer on the team. People and organizational skills are as important as technical know-how, so that Project Leads can effectively coordinate and align with others.

Some teams with more experienced members may need less guidance in certain areas and may even share responsibilities of this role across the team.

### Responsibilities

- Directly contribute through code, RFCs or PR reviews for a minimum of roughly 50% of their time.
- Collaborate with [product](../product/index.md) to maintain a [prioritized roadmap](../../direction/index.md) for the work owned by their team as well as quarterly [OKRs](../../company/okrs/index.md)
- Plan and commit to a set of work that will be accomplished by the team for each [monthly release](releases/index.md) and capture those commitments in a tracking issue on GitHub.
- Help keep the team focused on their goals while keeping them aware of the higher level picture.
- Identify blockers or productivity issues and work with the team to address them.
- Run weekly team sync meetings.
- Communicate progress to stakeholders and other parts of the company (e.g. at company meeting).
- Conduct monthly [retrospectives](../../retrospectives/index.md) with their team.
- Scale themselves out by organizing and delegating work to other teammates.
- Mentor and coach other teammates with timely feedback as appropriate in order to uphold team values and help them grow.
- Collaborate with Engineering Managers to ensure team mates have everything they need to succeed and deliver on the goals of the team.

## Engineering Manager

Engineering Managers are people managers who build teams of [Software Engineers](#software-engineer) to satisfy the needs of the business.

### Responsibilities

- Collaborate with [product](../product/index.md) to maintain a [prioritized roadmap](../../direction/index.md) for the work owned by your team.
- Commit to a set of work that will be accomplished by the team for each [monthly release](releases/index.md) and capture those commitments in a tracking issue on GitHub.
- Conduct monthly [retrospectives](../../retrospectives/index.md) with your team.
- Mentor and coach engineers through regular [1-1s](../leadership/1-1.md) to grow their careers.
- [Review the performance](../people-ops/review-cycles.md) of your direct reports to determine compensation.
- Interview candidates and own making improvements to our hiring process.
- Review applications and make final hiring decisions for candidates interested in your team.

## Switching roles

Switching between an individual contributor role and a people management role (or vice versa) is a role change (not a promotion or a demotion). Each role requires a different set of skills. Generally we expect people managers to have experience doing the role of their direct reports. Role changes may involve, or be driven by, a team organization change.

### Individual contributor to people manager

1. The IC is interested in becoming a people manager and understands how a people manager role differs from an individual contributor role.
2. The IC's manager agrees that the IC is a good candidate for a people manager role. Ideally the IC is already doing some parts of the job that are applicable â€” technical leadership, planning, mentoring. The IC's manager should collect feedback from relevant teammates.
3. The IC's manager identifies a small initial set of people for the IC to manage (e.g. 2-3 direct reports) for 1-2 months.
4. The IC's manager communicates to the team that this is a trial and the timeline for that trial.
5. The IC sets up [1-1s](../leadership/1-1.md) with their new reports and the IC's manager continues their 1-1s with these reports (but may reduce the candence).
6. Throughout the trial period the IC and the IC's manager discuss whether the trial is on track for success (and if not, what corrective actions can be taken).
7. After the trial period is over the IC's manager decides if the trial was a success.
  - Questions to consider:
    - Is the IC happy in the new role?
    - Are the IC's direct reports happy?
    - Is the IC's manager happy?
  - Outcomes:
    - If the trial was not a success then revert back to the previous state.
    - If the trial was a success then the IC is now a people manager and we can move forward with adding more direct reports in the future.
