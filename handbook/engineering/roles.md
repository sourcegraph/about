## Switching roles

Switching between an individual contributor role and a people management role (or vice versa) is a role change (not a promotion or a demotion). Each role requires a different set of skills. Generally we expect people managers to have experience doing the role of their direct reports. Role changes may involve, or be driven by, a team organization change.

### Individual contributor to people manager

1. The IC is interested in becoming a people manager and understands how a people manager role differs from an individual contributor role.
2. The IC's manager agrees that the IC is a good candidate for a people manager role. Ideally the IC is already doing some parts of the job that are applicable â€” technical leadership, planning, mentoring. The IC's manager should collect feedback from relevant teammates.
3. The IC's manager identifies a small initial set of people for the IC to manage (e.g. 2-3 direct reports) for 1-2 months.
4. The IC's manager communicates to the team that this is a trial and the timeline for that trial.
5. The IC sets up [1-1s](../leadership/1-1.md) with their new reports and the IC's manager continues their 1-1s with these reports (but may reduce the candence).
6. Throughout the trial period the IC and the IC's manager discuss whether the trial is on track for success (and if not, what corrective actions can be taken).
7. After the trial period is over the IC's manager decides if the trial was a success.
  - Questions to consider:
    - Is the IC happy in the new role?
    - Are the IC's direct reports happy?
    - Is the IC's manager happy?
  - Outcomes:
    - If the trial was not a success then revert back to the previous state.
    - If the trial was a success then the IC is now a people manager and we can move forward with adding more direct reports in the future.
