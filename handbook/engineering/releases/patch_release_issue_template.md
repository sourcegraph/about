# $MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH Patch Release

**Attention developers:** Add pending changes to this checklist, cherry-pick the relevant commits onto branch `$MAJOR.$MINOR`. **Only check off items if the relevant PR/commits have been cherry-picked into the branch**:

- [ ] TODO: Add PR or commit links here.
    ```
    git log v$MAJOR.$MINOR.$(($PATCH-1))...$MAJOR.$MINOR --pretty=format:'- [ ] %H %s' --reverse
    ```

## Setup

- [ ] Ensure release configuration in `dev/release/config.json` is up to date with the parameters for the current release.
- [ ] Ensure the latest version of the release tooling has been built before each step using `yarn run build` in `dev/release`.

## Release Sourcegraph

- [ ] Push the branch [`$MAJOR.$MINOR`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/tree/$MAJOR.$MINOR) with your cherry-picked commit(s) and make sure CI passes.
- [ ] Push a release candidate tag:
    ```
    git checkout '$MAJOR.$MINOR'
    git tag -a 'v$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH-rc.1' -m 'v$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH-rc.1' && git push origin 'v$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH-rc.1'
    ```
- [ ] If CI passes, push the release tag:
    ```
    git checkout '$MAJOR.$MINOR'
    git tag -a 'v$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH' -m 'v$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH' && git push origin 'v$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH'
    ```

Verify the Sourcegraph Server image works:

- [ ] Wait for the final Docker images to be available at https://hub.docker.com/r/sourcegraph/server/tags.
- [ ] Run the old and new images at least three times to make sure it starts:
    ```
    # 1. Answer YES to delete /tmp/sourcegraph with the old image
    IMAGE=sourcegraph/server:$MAJOR.$MINOR ./dev/run-server-image.sh
    
    # 2. Answer NO to delete /tmp/sourcegraph with the new image
    IMAGE=sourcegraph/server:$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH ./dev/run-server-image.sh
    
    # 3. Answer YES to delete /tmp/sourcegraph with the new image
    IMAGE=sourcegraph/server:$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH ./dev/run-server-image.sh
    ```

## Update Kubernetes deployment

- [ ] Open PRs that publish the new release:
  ```sh
  # Run this in the main sourcegraph repository in the `dev/release` directory on `main` branch:
  yarn run release release:stage
  ```
- [ ] Create a PR to update the [Kubernetes upgrade guide](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/updates/kubernetes) indicating the steps required to upgrade. Add the created pull request to the release campaign:
