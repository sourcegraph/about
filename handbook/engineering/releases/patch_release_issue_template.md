Only check off items if the commit have been cherry-picked into the `$MAJOR.$MINOR` branch by the release captain.

- [ ] TODO: Add [patch request issues](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Apatch-release-request) and their associated commits on `main` here

---

**Note:** All `yarn run release ...` commands should be run from folder `dev/release`.

**Note:** All `yarn run test ...` commands should be run from folder `web`.

## Setup

- [ ] Ensure release configuration in [`dev/release/release-config.jsonc`](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/blob/dev/release/release-config.jsonc) on `main` is up to date with the parameters for the current release.
- [ ] Ensure the latest version of the release tooling has been built before each step using `yarn run build` in `dev/release`.

## Prepare release

Ensure all patch changes are included:

- [ ] Ensure that all [patch request issues](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Apatch-release-request) are accounted for, and that the commits listed above has been cherry-picked to [`$MAJOR.$MINOR` release branch](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/tree/$MAJOR.$MINOR), and ensure CI passes on the release branch.
    ```
    git checkout $MAJOR.$MINOR
    git pull
    git cherry-pick <commit0> <commit1> ... # all relevant commits from the main branch
    git push $MAJOR.$MINOR
    ```
- [ ] Cherry-pick relevant [deploy-sourcegraph](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph) configuration changes from `master` to the [`$MAJOR.$MINOR` release branch](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph/tree/$MAJOR.$MINOR), and ensure CI passes on the release branch.
    ```
    git checkout $MAJOR.$MINOR
    git pull
    git cherry-pick <commit0> <commit1> ... # all relevant commits from the master branch
    git push $MAJOR.$MINOR
    ```
- [ ] Cherry-pick relevant [deploy-sourcegraph-docker](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker) configuration changes from `master` to the [`$MAJOR.$MINOR` release branch](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/$MAJOR.$MINOR), and ensure CI passes on the release branch.
    ```
    git checkout $MAJOR.$MINOR
    git pull
    git cherry-pick <commit0> <commit1> ... # all relevant commits from the master branch
    git push $MAJOR.$MINOR
    ```

Create and test release candidates:

- [ ] Push a release candidate tag:
    ```
    yarn run release release-candidate:create 1
    ```
- [ ] Wait for the release candidate Docker images to be available in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/sourcegraph/server/tags).
- [ ] Ensure the release candidate starts for upgrades and new instances:
    ```
    # 1. Answer YES to delete /tmp/sourcegraph with the old image
    IMAGE=sourcegraph/server:$MAJOR.$MINOR ./dev/run-server-image.sh
    
    # 2. Answer NO to delete /tmp/sourcegraph with the new image
    IMAGE=sourcegraph/server:$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH-rc.1 ./dev/run-server-image.sh
    
    # 3. Answer YES to delete /tmp/sourcegraph with the new image
    IMAGE=sourcegraph/server:$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH-rc.1 ./dev/run-server-image.sh
    ```

## Stage release

    ```
    yarn run release release-candidate:create final
    ```
- [ ] Wait for the release Docker images to be available in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/sourcegraph/server/tags).
- [ ] Open PRs that publish the new release and address any action items required to finalize draft PRs (track PR status via the [generated release campaign](https://k8s.sgdev.org/organizations/sourcegraph/campaigns)):
  ```sh
  yarn run release release:stage
  ```

## Release
