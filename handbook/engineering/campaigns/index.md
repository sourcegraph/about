# Campaigns team

User-facing documentation: https://docs.sourcegraph.com/user/campaigns

Developer documentation: https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/campaigns_development

### New, work-in-progress UX

We're working on a new flow and a new way for people to create campaigns based on the beta feedback. See [#10921](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/10921) and the following new doc pages (which are "pre-written" prior to being implemented to get us all on the same page about the changes we'll be making):

- [Campaigns main doc page](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/@campaigns-new-flow/user/campaigns)
- [Hello World Campaign guide](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/@campaigns-new-flow/user/campaigns/hello_world_campaign)
- [Campaigns design doc](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/@campaigns-new-flow/dev/campaigns_design)

## Vision

**Find code that needs to be changed and change it by running code**.

## Contact

- #campaigns-chat channel or @campaigns on Slack.
- [@sourcegraph/campaigns](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/teams/campaigns) team or [team/campaigns label](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ateam%2Fcampaigns+) on GitHub.

## Mission

Users can focus on changing their code because campaigns provides the plumbing:

* Finding the correct repositories in which to run code
* Fetching the newest version of each repository
* Running code in each repository
* Turn the result into patches
* Create pull requests from patches
* Draft, keep track of and update a large number of pull requests
* Re-running code when the base branch changes

Users provide the code to make the change, we provide the plumbing to turn it into a large-scale change and monitor its progress.

* We take care of all the bits and pieces that would rob users of their time and that are not essential to the change they want to make.
* We don't try to come up with fancy and seemingly magic ways of changing code (i.e. high-level tools to refactor code) before we get the fundamentals right (running users' code in thousands of repositories and turning that into thousands of pull requests).
* We don't interfere with the code that produces a change. We provide the infrastructure to run it across all of your repositories and turn it into a large-scale code change.

## Goals

The short-term goal and primary focus of the team is to *deliver campaigns to all users*. Our milestones toward that goal:

1. Someone on the Campaigns team makes one meaningful change to at least two repositories.
1. A Sourcegraph engineer (not on this team) makes one meaningful change to at least two repositories.
1. ~~Reach out to one customer, summarizing the changes in the new Campaigns workflow, to give them a heads-up.~~ **Done!**
1. ~~After we hear from that customer, we reach out to two other customers, as in previous step.~~ **Done!**
   - We are still waiting for feedback from these customers.
1. Work with Design to validate what we have with user testing.
1. After responding to feedback from at least 3 customers, we declare the state of Campaigns to be Good and Stable.
1. Reach out to a small set of customers using Campaigns.
   - Hypothesis: each one will reply within 3 days
   - Hypothesis: majority will create at least one new campaign with the new workflow
   - Hypothesis: majority will send us feedback about Campaigns

## Analogies

Netlify and AWS Lambda solve difficult, repeatable problems for developers, removing overhead and enabling them to focus on the problems they are solving. In that regard, campaigns are to large-scale code changes what Netlify is to static site generation and AWS Lambda is to handling HTTP requests.

When I write an AWS Lambda function I want to focus on which requests it receives and what response to send out. I don't want to worry about which server to run it on, how to scale it, secure it, add logging, keep track of its usage.

When I deploy a static site on Netlify I want to focus on my site — its content and design — and not think about where it's deployed, how to get new SSL certificates, how to install dependencies to run the static site generator on a server, how to preview the site in a pull request.

When I create a campaign to make large-scale code changes I want to _focus on the specific change I want to make across all of the code at my organization_. I don't want to worry about all of the overhead associated with execution, code hosts, and management of all things listed above.

## Process

For each iteration (currently one month long), we follow this process:

* Before the iteration begins, each team member prepares for the iteration planning meeting by considering what they would like to see in the next iteration, and by looking over [our backlog](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/labels/team%2Fcampaigns) and setting the Milestone for issues we'd like to include.
* We then have our planning meeting to determine our common goals for the iteration. We create a [tracking issue](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/engineering/tracking_issues) for the iteration which will hold our goals and plans, in addition to tracking the issues we intend to address.
* Each Monday, the team meets with stakeholders to stay in sync, and to set our personal goals for the week. We record these goals, and the previous week's progress, as status update comments on the tracking issue. The engineering manager then compiles these into a summary which is sent to the team and stakeholders.
* Each day, Slack reminds us to do our stand-up, which consists of a *short* message (it shouldn't take longer than 30s to write) in the reminder's thread. As we are a globally distributed team, this can be a statement of intent for the day, or a recap of what we have finished that day.
* After the release branch has been cut for the iteration, the team has a retro to discuss how the iteration went, and what changes we might want to our working agreements.

## Working Agreements

* To avoid siloing of knowledge and to keep teammates happy, we make sure that everyone gets a chance to work in different areas of the codebase. In particular, we don't want tasks in area X to always default to person P.
* If a process isn't serving us, we are quick to shut it down.

## Team Communication

Our team has two Slack channels, one public (#campaigns-chat) and one private (#campaigns-team). _Our default is to use the public channel._

The private channel is for communications that would be of no interest to someone not on the team. Things like (re-)scheduling of team meetings, vacation scheduling, reminders about tasks that need completing, etc. Keeping these out of the public channel raises the signal-to-noise ratio for folks interested in Campaigns, but not interested in who will be 10 minutes late to our sync meeting today due to the fact that their cat knocked over a jar of pickles and now there's glass everywhere and everything smells like vinegar and now you wish you hadn't read this sentence to the end.
