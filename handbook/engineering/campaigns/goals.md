# Campaigns goals

The campaigns team is building the best solution available for creating and managing large scale changes. To do so we will focus on the following objectives:

## Grow adoption of campaigns 

We need to grow usage of campaigns to understand our customer use cases and inform our roadmap.

How do we do this:
  * Proactive customer outreach
  * Continual user validation
  * Strive to create a frictionless initial experience
  * Provide amazing support

Our success metrics:
  * Build a base of 10 customers who have created 80 campaigns and made 4000 changesets in Q4
  * [Looker dashboard with usage metrics](https://sourcegraph.looker.com/dashboards/136) (internal only)


## Design and build the most robust, yet easy to use solution for creating changesets across many repositories

Campaigns need to be easy to explain, easy to understand, easy to start using, and easy to explore. At the same time, it should be the most powerful tool available for making programatic changes to multiple repositories. 

How do we do this:
  * Clean conceptual model
  * Expressive syntax
  * Understand our customers environments and requirements
  * Strong alignment of features to developer objectives
  * Excellent docs, tutorials, demos/training
  * Best debugging experience

Our success metrics:
  * Reduction of feature requests over time

## Build the best solution for managing large numbers of changesets

Much of the work in completing a large scale change across many repos is in getting the changesets merged. We want to be the best tool for all aspects of changeset management.

How do we do this:
  * Help users understand the overall status of their campaign
  * Provide tools to find and resolve problematic changesets
  * Provide flexible tools to prompt reviewers and owners to merge the created changesets in whatever way best suits the customer
  * Integrate with issue tracking systems

Our success metrics:
  * Seconds from changeset create to changeset merged
  * Percentage of customer changesets merged is greater than (TBD)

## Increase the scope of campaigns

Today, campaigns are intended for creating changesets in many owned repositories on a few code hosts. Eventually, we want to increase the scope of what we intend campaigns to be used for.

How do we do this:
  * Add support for monorepos
  * Add support for other code hosts
  * Enable campaigns on open source projects

Our success metrics:
  * TBD

## Improve quality and stability 

Campaigns need to be rock-solid, dependable, and robust.

How do we do this:
  * Automated end-to-end testing

Our success metrics:
  * TBD
