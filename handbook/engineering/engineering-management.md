# Engineering management

This page documents resources that are relevant and valuable to anyone on the engineering team, but in particular to engineering leaders.

## Slack

- #eng-manager-internal is a public channel where engineering managers can discuss work as a [first team](https://lethain.com/first-team/).
- #leadership-chat is a public channel (not specific to engineering) where anyone can discuss and share information of general interest to leadership at Sourcegraph.
- #manager-team is a private channel where managers across functions can solicit advice from and share info with fellow managers about topics that they do not feel comfortable discussing in #leadership-chat for any reason.

## Status updates

The goal of status updates is to communicate each team's progress toward their OKRs and roadmap items.

Engineering managers send an update to [engineering-team-status@sourcegraph.com](https://groups.google.com/a/sourcegraph.com/g/engineering-team-status) after each iteration retrospective. Teams have different iteration cadences, and as such, we do not expect updates to come through on the same day, but it should follow soon after you have completed your retrospective for the iteration.

You may send an update anytime (you don't need to wait for the end of an iteration). It might help communicate the achievement of an important milestone or significant change of plans mid-iteration.

Delegate to someone else on your team to send the update when you are on vacation.

While any teammate can join the group to receive these updates, your target audience is up (your manager) and out (your peers). You can also cc your team.

Please include the following content in your update:

- The email subject should contain the team name and the date (e.g., "Search update 2020-10-14") so each update starts a distinct email thread (otherwise, they get grouped in the Google Groups UI).
- Follow the [3Ps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress,_plans,_problems) approach to reporting on the _Progress_, ~~Problems~~ _Challenges_, and _Plans_ against the team's goals.
- Managers should favor a prose style communication over a changelog style update.

### Company meeting demos

We're experimenting with showing short (<1m) demo videos (max 1 per week) during company meeting. If your team ships something that would make a great demo, send an update to engineering-team-status@ to let us know. Requirements:

- 1 minute or less
- Recorded 
- Voiceover that explains the problem that the feature solves and which specific customers had that problem
- Just show a demo of the actual product as if you were showing a friend, you don't need to have slides or anything
- Example:
  - https://groups.google.com/a/sourcegraph.com/g/engineering-team-status/c/70Dr1h7Ixe4
  - https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/CHEKCRWKV/p1615424478168600

## Book recommendations

Here are some books that multiple people on the team have read and recommend. If you haven't read these, [use your education budget](../people-ops/travel.md#professional-development-and-education) and read them!

- [Turn the Ship Around](https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers/dp/1591846404/) - An inspiring story of how Navy captain David Marquet turned the lowest performing submarine in the Navy into the top performing one with his bottom's up leadership style.
- [Orbiting the Giant Hairball](https://www.amazon.com/Orbiting-Giant-Hairball-Corporate-Surviving/dp/0670879835/) - An entertaining self-account of Gordon MacKenzie's experience fostering creativity on his team at Hallmark Cards. Buy the hard copy. There are lots of fun illustrations and short stories. It is a quick read and probably unlike any other book you have read.
- [Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/the-book/) - How to be a great leader by caring personally and challenging directly.
- [An Elegant Puzzle](https://lethain.com/elegant-puzzle/) - A field manual on how to do engineering management. Reads like a well structured markdown file.
- [The Five Dysfunctions of a Team](https://www.amazon.com/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Fable/dp/0787960756) - A model of how to think about what makes a highly effective team paired with a fictional story that illustrates the model.
- [The Leader’s Guide to Unconscious Bias](https://www.amazon.com/Leaders-Guide-Unconscious-Bias-High-Performing/dp/1982144319) ([facilitated small group discussions](../support/support-values-enablement.md#part-2-deep-dive-on-be-welcoming-and-inclusive).

## Promotion requests

To be documented.

## Compensation increase requests

To be documented.

## Temporary management positions

We create temporary management positions when there is an organizational need. Some examples:

- A team has grown beyond the [maximum viable team guideline](eng_org.md#maximum-viable-team), and we decide to split the team.
- An Engineering Manager is out on extended PTO.
- We decide to form a new team from scratch. 

### Acting manager

An Acting Manager occupies a management role temporarily and will move back to their original position after a set amount of time or other conditions. An Acting Manager could be filling in for a vacant role while we hire or providing cover for another Engineering Manager on extended PTO.

### Manager in training

Manager in training positions are for teammates pursuing an Engineering Manager role long term but who lack the necessary people management experience. We want to allow teammates to consider if they would like to make the role switch and verify that they would be good in the role.

#### Requirements for a manager in training role

The following requirements are in place to ensure we set up the manager in training for success.

1. The candidate's manager or another nominated manager must commit to providing extra support to the manager in training for the duration of the trial period. They become the sponsoring manager.
1. The candidate should have a track record of good performance at Sourcegraph and should be employed at Sourcegraph for a minimum of 6 months before taking on the manager in training role.
1. The candidate's existing team must be in a position for them not to be involved as an IC for the whole duration of the trial period. Managers in training should not fulfill a dual role.
1. The managed team must comply with our [minimum viable team](eng_org.md#minimum-viable-team) criteria.
1. The managed team must have a dedicated and established Product Manager assigned to it.

#### Trial period

1. The trial period will last 12 weeks but may be extended if agreed to by the manager in training and the sponsoring manager. The trial period should not be extended to more than 16 weeks.
1. The sponsoring manager will conduct bi-weekly 1-1s with the manager in training's direct reports to collect feedback and set them up for success.
1. The manager in training will receive active coaching and feedback from the sponsoring manager during weekly 1-1s.
1. The manager in training will receive an interim performance evaluation halfway through their trial period to help them identify strengths and shortcomings.
1. The trial period can be canceled by the manager in training or the sponsoring manager if it is not working out.

#### Responsibilities of the manager in training

The manager in training will assume full Engineering Manager responsibility as outlined in the [Engineering Manager responsibilities](roles.md#engineering-manager).

#### Promotion to Engineering Manager

Suppose the trial period for the manager in training was determined to be successful, and they would like to commit to the role change. In that case, the sponsoring manager will submit a [promotion request](#promotion-requests) as per our standard process.
