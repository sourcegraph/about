## Vision

**Find code that needs to be changed and change it at scale by running code.**

This is the inspirational end game state for Batch Changes in 3 years:

- **Code invariants** - Describe a code pattern once, and your batch change will fix it everywhere, automatically, forever, thanks to its declarative model.
- **Continuous maintenance** - Instead of deferring codebase maintenance to large, painful, and risky changes, Batch Changes lets developers introduce changes incrementally and in a safe and automated way. Much like CI/CD increased efficiency and reduced risk through small deployments, Batch Changes lets developers make incremental codebase-wide changes.
- **In-editor and instant feedback** - Developers don’t leave the editor to create or be notified of changesets. Repository owners can discover and apply great code patterns faster. Linters are not enough: when you catch a new pattern, you want to make sure it's not introduced again (lint), but also fix it everywhere it already exists.
- **Universal Batch Changes** - Make changes to public and private code. Open source projects can provide batch specs so that their dependents can seamlessly upgrade. Batch Changes eases upgrading in private and on-premise environments.

## Contact

- #batch-changes channel or @batchers on Slack.
- [@sourcegraph/batchers](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/teams/batchers) team or [team/batchers label](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ateam%2Fbatchers) on GitHub.

## Mission

Users can focus on changing their code because Batch Changes provides the plumbing:

- Finding the correct repositories in which to run code
- Fetching the newest version of each repository
- Running code in each repository
- Turn the result into patches
- Create pull requests from patches
- Draft, keep track of and update a large number of pull requests
- Re-running code when the base branch changes

Users provide the code to make the change, we provide the plumbing to turn it into a large-scale change and monitor its progress.

- We take care of all the bits and pieces that would rob users of their time and that are not essential to the change they want to make.
- We don't try to come up with fancy and seemingly magic ways of changing code (i.e. high-level tools to refactor code) before we get the fundamentals right (running users' code in thousands of repositories and turning that into thousands of pull requests).
- We don't interfere with the code that produces a change. We provide the infrastructure to run it across all of your repositories and turn it into a large-scale code change.

## Goals and priorities

See our [goals and priorities](goals.md)

## Metrics

We track and report anonymous, non-specific, aggregate metrics from Sourcegraph instances as defined in [pings](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/pings).

### Key success metrics

We track success metrics in a (private) [Looker dashboard](https://sourcegraph.looker.com/dashboards-next/174)

| Outcome                                            | Metric                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Are developers using Batch Changes?                | number of batch changes created, number of changesets published        |
| Are batch changes successful?                      | merge rate of batch changes (changesets merged / changesets published) |
| Is Batch Changes being adopted [broadly](#Vision)? | number of monthly contributors and MAUs                                |

### Definitions

- **Batch Changes MAU:** A visitor who triggers any event happening on a Sourcegraph Batch Changes property in a given month. In practice, we do not track CLI events, so this effectively only includes events in the GUI, or uploading a spec.
- **Batch Changes monthly contributor:** A user that has taken an action to create or manage a batch change in a given month. In practice, a user that has previewed, or applied or closed a batch change in a given month. New actions that are added in the future, such as [comment, merge, publish](https://sourcegraph.productboard.com/roadmap/2263724-batch-changes-releases/features/6775792/portal) will be added.

## Analogies

Netlify and AWS Lambda solve difficult, repeatable problems for developers, removing overhead and enabling them to focus on the problems they are solving. In that regard, batch changes are to large-scale code changes what Netlify is to static site generation and AWS Lambda is to handling HTTP requests.

When I write an AWS Lambda function I want to focus on which requests it receives and what response to send out. I don't want to worry about which server to run it on, how to scale it, secure it, add logging, keep track of its usage.

When I deploy a static site on Netlify I want to focus on my site — its content and design — and not think about where it's deployed, how to get new SSL certificates, how to install dependencies to run the static site generator on a server, how to preview the site in a pull request.

When I create a batch change to make large-scale code changes I want to _focus on the specific change I want to make across all of the code at my organization_. I don't want to worry about all of the overhead associated with execution, code hosts, and management of all things listed above.

## Process

- We prioritize our work in [this project](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/119). It is the responsibility of the PM and EM to keep this updated and correct.

- Each day, Slack reminds us to do our text check-in, which consists of a _short_ message (it shouldn't take longer than a minute to write) in the reminder's thread. This should be a recap of what we have finished that day.

- One Big Thing: Each sprint, each engineer gets one big thing to work on — one significant chunk of work scoped to be doable in a single sprint (leaving some slack in the sprint for customer support and other unexpected issues). When it is completed, engineers will pull P0 items from [our planning project](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/119) into the current sprint to work on (or P1 if there are no P0s).

- Invariants and assumptions:
  - Issues have the current milestone set if-and-only-if they are P0.
  - An issue assigned to an engineer means that engineer is committing to finishing _in the current sprint_. Issues should be unassigned by default.

### Sprint planning

Our two-week sprints start every other Wednesday. We follow this process:

- Before the iteration (sprint N+1) begins, we do pre-planning to make the most of our the planning meeting:

  - EM creates the milestone for sprint N+1.
  - EM checks for [untracked issues](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Aproject+label%3Ateam%2Fbatchers) and adds them to the "Needs prioritization" column of [our planning project](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/119).
  - Everyone on the team looks through our planning project for any issues they do not expect to finish by the end of the sprint (EOD Tuesday), and set the next sprint's milestone.
  - Engineers add/refine estimates to issues in the planning project. All estimates in GitHub are assumed to be upper-bound estimates. (A missing estimate means "between 1 second and 1 trillion years.")
  - Everyone on the team reviews our [roadmap in Productboard](https://sourcegraph.productboard.com/roadmap/2263724-campaigns-releases) for the current/next release.

- We then have our planning meeting to determine our common goals for the iteration. The process for this is described in our [agenda doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d4_WndknEd23BNUFG05-KEV4pq2MNx8mdZedVnZpLCg/edit#).

- After sprint planning, the team has a retro to discuss how the previous sprint went, and what changes we might want to our working agreements.

## Working Agreements

- To avoid siloing of knowledge and to keep teammates happy, we make sure that everyone gets a chance to work in different areas of the codebase. In particular, we don't want tasks in area X to always default to person P. We want to strike a healthy balance between spreading knowledge around and building individual expertise in one area.
- We do not schedule team meetings on Fridays. (Folks are free to pair on Fridays if they want.)
- We do not scramble to get last-minute changes in before branch-cut. (If it's a blocking issue, there's [a process for that](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/engineering/releases#issues).)
- If there is no agenda in our sync doc for our team syncs by 5 minutes before the meeting starts, then the meeting will be cancelled.
- If a process isn't serving us, we are quick to either change it or get rid of it.
- We aim to improve the developer experience of working on the Batch Changes and the larger Sourcegraph codebase as we work on it. We do that by allowing ourselves to set aside time to implement improvements if we see a chance to do so. For example: it's okay to spend half a day improving our test tooling if we know that it will make things easier for us and others in the future.
- By default, we record team meetings with 3+ participants (with exceptions for social meetings and retros).

## Team Communication

Our team has two Slack channels, one for everyone (#batch-changes) and one just for us (#batch-changes-internal). _Our default is to use the public channel._

The private channel is for communications that would be of no interest to someone not on the team. Things like (re-)scheduling of team meetings, vacation scheduling, reminders about tasks that need completing, etc. Keeping these out of the public channel raises the signal-to-noise ratio for folks interested in Batch Changes, but not interested in who will be 10 minutes late to our sync meeting today due to the fact that their cat knocked over a jar of pickles and now there's glass everywhere and everything smells like vinegar and now you wish you hadn't read this sentence to the end.

## Stewardship of src-cli

The Batch Changes team is the current owner of [src-cli](https://github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli), due to the fact that most of the src-cli work in recent months has been related to Batch Changes. We do not expect to be the permanent owners of src-cli; when another team becomes the main contributor, we will transfer ownership to them.
