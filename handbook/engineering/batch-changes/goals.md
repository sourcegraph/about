# Batch Changes direction

This page outlines the vision, strategy and goals of the Batch Changes team.

# Vision

#### 3 Year vision

> Developers can easily create changesets across many repositories and codehosts, and track them to completion

#### 10 year vision

> Automate code changes are a common practice for all developers.

## Mission

We allow users to focus on changing their code, without having to do any plumbing. We help users drive changesets to completion without relying on spreadhseets and painful coordination. We also want to make writing and running code that changes code more accessible.
