# Goals

# Overarching goal: Deliver Batch Changes to as many users as possible

Batch Changes is GA and already creates value for some early adopters. The next step is to onboard a broader audience.
Batch Changes will be most valuable for users with large codebases and teams, which are more likely to be found at large tech startups or in the enterprise. Therefore, our primary goal now is to increase adoption of Batch Changes for our enterprise customers.
Longer term, we want to push continuous code maintenance and Batch Changes to every developer.

Progress on adoption and usage is tracked in this [Looker dashboard](https://sourcegraph.looker.com/dashboards/136).

**Problem**

- Our customers have diverse environments, configurations and workflows, that Batch Changes needs to be able to fit into.

**Outcomes**

- We onboard N1 new customers and N2 changesets get created (N1 and N2 in OKRs)
- We track usage with a monthly MAUs and customer penetration report
- CE and sales are equipped with enough material and examples to demonstrate the value of Batch Changes to a broad range of users with varied workflows.

## Objective: Users can create, manage and track large scale Batch Changes

**Milestones**

- âœ… Batch Changes supports monorepos
- Rate limiting: users can create large scale changesets without breaking code host or CI
- Users can manipulate (push, close, comment on) many changesets

**Outcome**

- N3% of users creating 100+ batch changes report success

## Objective: Broad adoption of Batch Changes and great developer experience

We want to make it so that Batch Changes is easy to onboard and use, not only for a few power users, but for all software engineers. This is a key limitation of existing in-house tooling at out customers.

**Outcomes**

- Developers from teams outside infrastructure / developer services start using batch changes
- N4% of users that land on the Batch Changes dashboard become Active Batch Changes Maintainers

## Objective: Changeset creators get changesets merged faster

A batch change is successful when its changes get merged.

**Outcomes**

- We have a weekly, actionable time-to-merge report
- We observe that time-to-merge decreases over time (goal TBD)

## Objective: Recurring batch changes

**Outcomes**

- Users can set batch changes to run recurrently

# Roadmap

We maintain a [directionally correct roadmap](https://sourcegraph.productboard.com/roadmap/2400849-campaings-objectives-public), updated as feedback comes in. Timelines and priorities can change.

# How we built those goals and milestones

We generally think about Batch Change efforts in terms of 4 themes:

1. create many changesets easily
1. track, manage, and merge many changesets easily
1. expand the realm where batch changes can run
1. keep batch changes robust and performant
