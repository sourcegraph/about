# Playbooks for deployments

## Sourcegraph.com

To learn more about this deployment, see [instances](./instances.md#sourcegraph-com).

### Deploying to sourcegraph.com

Every commit to the `release` branch (the default branch) on [deploy-sourcegraph-dot-com](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-dot-com) deploys the Kubernetes YAML in this repository to our dot-com cluster [in CI](https://buildkite.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-dot-com/builds?branch=release) (i.e. if CI is green then the latest config in the `release` branch is deployed).

Deploys on sourcegraph.com are currently [handled by Renovate](#renovate). The [Renovate dashboard](https://app.renovatebot.com/dashboard#github/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-dot-com) shows logs for previous runs and allows you to predict when the next run will happen.

If you want to expedite a deploy, you can manually create and merge a PR that updates the Docker image tags in [deploy-sourcegraph-dot-com](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-dot-com). You can find the desired Docker image tags by looking at the output of the Docker build step in [CI on sourcegraph/sourcegraph `main` branch](https://buildkite.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/builds?branch=main) or by looking at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/sourcegraph/).

### Rolling back sourcegraph.com

To roll back soucegraph.com, push a new commit to the `release` branch in [deploy-sourcegraph-dot-com](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-dot-com) that reverts the image tags and configuration to the desired state.

```sh
# Ensure that you're up-to-date
git checkout release
git pull

# Rollback the release branch to $COMMIT
# See https://stackoverflow.com/a/21718540 if you want more context
git revert --no-commit $COMMIT..HEAD

# Push the revert commit back to the release branch
git commit
git push origin release
```

[Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-dot-com/) will deploy the working commit to sourcegraph.com.

ðŸš¨ You also need to disable auto-deploys to prevent Renovate from automatically merging in image digest updates so that the site doesn't roll-forward.

1. Go to [renovate.json](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-dot-com/blob/release/renovate.json) and remove the `"extends:["default:automergeDigest"]` entry for the "Sourcegraph Docker images" group ([example](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-dot-com/commit/0eb16fd9e3ddfcf3a3c75ccdda0e7eddabf19c7a)).
1. Once you have fixed the issue in the `main` branch of [sourcegraph/sourcegraph](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph), re-enable auto-deploys by reverting your change to [renovate.json](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-dot-com/blob/release/renovate.json) from step 1.

### Accessing sourcegraph.com database

#### Via the CLI

Sourcegraph.com utilizes an external HA database. You will need to connect to it directly. The easiest way to do this is through the `gcloud` cli.

To connect to the production database:

```
  gcloud beta sql connect sg-cloud-732a936743 --user=sg -d sg --project sourcegraph-dev
```

However, if you want to use any other SQL client, you'll have to run the [`cloud_sql_proxy`](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/connect-admin-proxy#install) utility, which authenticates with you local `gcloud` credentials automatically.

```
  cloud_sql_proxy -instances=sourcegraph-dev:us-central1:sg-cloud-732a936743=tcp:5555
```

Once the proxy connects successfully, you can use any client to connect to the local `5555` port (you can choose any other port you want).

The password of the sg user is in our shared 1Password under [Google Cloud SQL](https://team-sourcegraph.1password.com/vaults/dnrhbauihkhjs5ag6vszsme45a/allitems/svfiw4vcbxhhbobpl442olyebu)

#### Via BigQuery (for read-only operations)

You can also query the production database via BigQuery as an external data source.

See an [example query](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?sq=527047051561:bfa7c7e57f884d209f261d15e4610229) to get started.

**Note**: This method only permits read-only access

## k8s.sgdev.org

To learn more about this deployment, see [instances](./instances.md#k8s-sgdev-org).

### Manage users in k8s.sgdev.org

To create an account on [k8s.sgdev.org](https://k8s.sgdev.org), log in with your Sourcegraph Google account via OpenID Connect.

To promote a user to site admin (required to make configuration changes), use the admin user credentials available in 1password (titled `k8s.sgdev.org admin user`) to log in to [k8s.sgdev.org](https://k8s.sgdev.org), and go to the [users page](https://k8s.sgdev.org/site-admin/users) to promote the desired user.

## Cloudflare Configuration
