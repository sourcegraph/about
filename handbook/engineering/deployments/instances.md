This deployment is also colloquially referred to as "Sourcegraph Cloud", "Cloud", and "dot-com". It is the public deployment available to the public at [sourcegraph.com/search](https://sourcegraph.com/search).

`sourcegraph.com` deploys the latest changes from [`sourcegraph/sourcegraph`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph) on a schedule via [Renovate](./index.md#renovate)

> üê∂ For dogfooding changes, use [k8s.sgdev.org](#k8s-sgdev-org) instead, which generally receives updates faster.

This deployment is also colloquially referred to as "dogfood", "dogfood-k8s", or just "k8s". This is the Sourcegraph instance to use for dogfooding changes to Sourcegraph. It contains Sourcegraph private code, and generally receives the latest changes within 20 to 30 minutes.

`k8s.sgdev.org` deploys the latest changes in [`deploy-sourcegraph`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph), and by extension, [`sourcegraph/sourcegraph`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph), via automated updates - learn more in [deployment basics](./index.md#deployment-basics).
