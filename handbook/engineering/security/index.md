## How we respond to security vulnerability reports

When we receive [a report of a security vulnerability](https://about.sourcegraph.com/security#how-to-report-a-security-vulnerability), a member of our security team determines if a reported vulnerability should be investigated by an engineer.

- If so, a member of our security team will [file a vulnerability report in sourcegraph/security-issues](https://github.com/sourcegraph/security-issues/issues/new/choose) and follow the checklist in the issue template.

- If not, a member of our security team will respond to the report to notify the reporter why we are not acting on the report.

  > Thank you for your report. Could you please provide us with $INFOX, $INFOY, and $INFOZ so we can investigate this further? 

  > Thank you for your report. We will not be taking further action on this report because $REASONS.
