## Mission Statement

Campaigns are to large-scale code changes what Netlify is to static site generation and AWS Lambda is to handling HTTP requests.

When I write an AWS Lambda function I want to focus on which requests it receives and what response to send out. I don't want to worry about which server to run it on, how to scale it, secure it, add logging, keep track of its usage.

When I deploy a static site on Netlify I want to focus on my site — its content and design — and not think about where it's deployed, how to get new SSL certificates, how to install dependencies to run the static site generator on a server, how to preview the site in a pull request.

**Campaigns allow users to focus on finding code that needs to be changed and changing it by running code**.

Campaign users don't have to worry about:

* Finding the correct repositories in which to run code
* Fetching the newest version of each repository
* Running code in each repository
* Turn the result into patches
* Create pull requests from patches
* Draft, keep track of and update a large number of pull requests
* Re-running code when the base branch changes
