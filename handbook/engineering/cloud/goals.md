# Cloud goals and priorities

## Guiding principles

1. **Make it work**: Build the backend blocking work, and expose it (even in a roughly usable way) to the Sourcegraph team. We will be able to quickly surface any glaring issues and will have more thoughts around usability. Take shortcuts where possible (this is currently due to the team having fewer frontend resources).
   - Where possible, making it work and usable should be combined (avoid duplicate efforts), but if it's possible to separate the two in order to move things forward, we should!
1. **Make it smooth**: The experience has been designed and thought through. We feel good about putting this in front of users, and they will find it valuable!
1. **Make it fast**: Now that users can try it, make sure the experience is fast for them (but it's better to have a slow working feature than a fast not-working one).
1. **Make it scale**: Make it work at large scale. Up until now we have been starting to grow awareness of the feature, so the number of users is starting to matter. It is better to have high demand and need to surge on scalability than to make an infinitely scalable unused feature.

## Goals

### Private code on Sourcegraph Cloud

**Problem:** Customers who want to use Sourcegraph with their private code must setup and run a Sourcegraph instance on their own compute infrastructure. There are customers who want to use Sourcegraph but don't want to have to deploy and operate their own Sourcegraph instance and associated compute infrastructure. These customers expect to be able to search over only the code they care about, and are not inundated with public or irrelevant code. To host private code on Sourcegraph Cloud, we need to not only ensure the security of our product (which is important for on-premise deployments too), but we also have to ensure the security of our Sourcegraph Cloud infrastructure.

**Milestones:**

1. âœ… The Sourcegraph organization and team members can add public code from GitHub.com, GitLab.com, and Bitbucket Cloud.
1. ðŸ”„ The Sourcegraph organization and team members can add private code to Sourcegraph Cloud.
1. ðŸ”„ Any user can add public code from GitHub.com, GitLab.com, and Bitbucket Cloud.
1. Organization admins can manage membership (wording WIP).
1. Any user or organization can add private code to Sourcegraph Cloud for free before it's GA.
1. Sourcegraph Cloud is a paid product that is Generally Available (GA)

### Backend infrastructure

Backend infrastructure goals are ad hoc as requests come up from customers or other teams. The Cloud team is responsible for scheduling and prioritizing these requests as they come up. See the [roadmap](../../product/roadmap.md#cloud) for planned items.

## Roadmap

1. âœ… User added code is indexed
1. âœ… Users do not need to take any steps for a repository they add to be searchable
1. ðŸ”„ [RFC 167: Product license tiers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XozQ4JINJqirdaG-XqGtboT2-PlIXPyBn6EwV7Q3pWI/edit?ts=5f0811cf#heading=h.trqab8y0kufp)
1. ðŸ”„ Syncing repos is more scalable
1. ðŸ”„ Metrics/monitoring in place to ensure a good experience
1. GitHub app to have users sign in with GitHub and select the repos/organizations that have access.
1. Use webhooks to receive updates on anything that is relevant to this userâ€™s connection to GitHub
1. Equivalent things to GitLab and Bitbucket Cloud
1. User understands state and progress of their configured repositories and associated metadata
1. [UX TBD: New sign up/auth flow]
1. [UX TBD: Communicate state]

Unplanned:

- [Non-Git VCS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y2xYbckAz5jlBePER_BarypeDfP3mjjX9bBOZm3ALqY/edit#heading=h.m60esa7uysvx)

### Old notes

- Connecting their first code host and adding their own public repos is intuitive and easy for new and existing users.
   - System activity and progress is easy to understand and doesnâ€™t take too long.
     - Repo syncing
     - Repo indexing
- No plaintext tokens or secrets anywhere (including gitserver .git/config remotes).
   - All private repository content are only decryptable by Sourcegraph services.
     - Gitserver.
     - Searcher and code intel caches.
     - Any other service that needs access to repository contents needs to be able to decrypt what it needs on the fly.
   - Searching the user's or organization's private code versus searching all Cloud code is intuitive.
   - **DEPENDENCY:** We first need to finish [user configured public code on Sourcegraph Cloud](#user-configured-public-code-on-sourcegraph-cloud).
- Authorization from code hosts is enforced (e.g., organizations, teams).
   - Repository visibility and permissions on Sourcegraph is intuitive.
   - Adding private repositories is part of the same flows as adding public repositories.
   - **DEPENDENCY**: We need to have [visibility into our attack surface](../security/index.md#visibility-into-sourcegraph-clouds-attack-surface).
- Abuse protection: API rate limiting, DDoS mitigation, limiting user accounts.
   - Scalable syncing of permissions, repos, changesets.
   - High availability, SLOs, etc.
   - Billing and subscriptions.
   - [Confidence in our security model](../security/index.md#confidence-in-our-security-model).
