# Cloud team

The cloud team owns all work that is necessary to build, secure, scale, and operate our multi-tenant hosted version of Sourcegraph for customers that do not want to deploy Sourcegraph on-premise.

## Goals

1. Any user or organization can use Sourcegraph Cloud with both the private and public code that they care about in a secure way.

## Contact

- #cloud channel or @cloud-team in Slack
- [team/cloud](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/new?labels=team/cloud) label in GitHub.

## Resources

- [Tracking Issues](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+label%3Ateam%2Fcloud+label%3Atracking)

## Processes

We do [weekly check-ins](../tracking_issues.md#using-a-tracking-issue-for-progress-check-ins) and [monthly planning](../tracking_issues.md#planning-a-milestone-with-a-tracking-issue).

## Members

- [Tomás Senart](../../../company/team/index.md#tomás-senart) ([engineering manager](../roles.md#engineering-manager))
- [Joe Chen](../../../company/team/index.md#joe-chen)
- [Ryan Slade](../../../company/team/index.md#ryan-slade)
- [Dax McDonald](../../../company/team/index.md#dax-mcdonald-he-him)
- [Asdine El Hrychy](../../../company/team/index.md#asdine-el-hrychy)

Other:

- [Keegan Carruthers-Smith](../../../company/team/index.md#keegan-carruthers-smith) will not be isolating his work to a single team. Instead, he will serially choose tasks that he thinks are important to work on and he will post updates to the most relevant tracking issue on GitHub. This is an experiment for the next month and we will evaluate the outcome on 2020-08-17. Tomás will continue to be his manager during this experiment.
