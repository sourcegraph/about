# Code walkthrough

The following page details how we approach the technical hiring within the Code Intelligence team instead of take home projects.

### What is the day to day engineering experience at Sourcegraph?
- We're often reading code we haven't written.
- We're functioning in an asynchronous environment where clear communication is key.
- We need to help our team understand areas where we are the domain expert.

### What do we want to be true about this interview?
- Allow you as the candidate to focus on an area that you are comfortable in.
- Allow a dialogue that simulates a technical discussion between your potential future peers.
- Use the discussion as a proxy for technical aptitude and programming skills.
- Have a time efficient process for yourself and Sourcegraph.

### We want to find engineers that are:
- Good communicators.
- Can tailor the technical depth and scope of a conversation dependent on the audience.
- Can effectively teach and share their knowledge.

### Overview

For this interview you'll drive a walkthrough of either a personal project or library of your choice.

The following are sample ideas, the most important thing is you choose a library that you are comfortable and familiar with.  Walkthroughs can be done in
any language, we do have a preference if possible that they are close to the domain you'd be working in.

- For a full-stack position you may choose a library that you've used heavily such as [DateJs](https://github.com/datejs/Datejs)
or to guide us through [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux).
- If you're interviewing for a backend position you may choose a library such as [Mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) or [Ristretto](https://github.com/dgraph-io/ristretto).

---
- Interview length: 45 minutes
    - 5 minutes of introductions.
    - 30 minute walkthrough (script below).
    - 10 minutes of questions.
- Be ready to screenshare the library in question via your IDE or editor of choice.
- At some point during the discussion, the engineers will ask you to describe a function of their choice in
  which you'll walk them through the language constructs and flow.

### Interview script

As we're attempting to stimulate a technical discussion between peers the following list is an outline of
how we'll approach the conversation.  The ordering below is not indicative of the flow of the discussion.

- What problem does this library solve?
- If we wanted to use this, how would we get started?
_Screensharing would now begin_
- Can you show us where we'd instantiate the library?
- What's the high level architecture?
- Can you explain some of the different levels of abstraction?
- What would you change about the library?
- What is a clear flaw the library has?
- What is an understandable piece of tech debt? How would go about refactoring this?
- If you were to solve this problem from scratch, what different tradeoffs would you make?
