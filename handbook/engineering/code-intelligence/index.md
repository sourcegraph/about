# Code intelligence team

[Roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cBsE9801DcBF9chZyMnxRdolqM_1c2pPyGQz15QAvYI/edit#heading=h.dimwsc9ccmwq)

## Vision

Code intelligence is as good or better than an IDE in the browser for all code hosts and all languages, including cross-repository definitions and references.

## Direction

The Code Intelligence team builds tools and services that provide contextual information around code, taking into account its lexical, syntactic, and semantic structure. This includes:

- An API to provide fast, comprehensive, and accurate answers to important code navigation queries such as Go to Definition and Find References

- A powerful and flexible language-agnostic model of dependency relationships across projects, repositories, and languages

- Robust, extensible, and scalable infrastructure to index code across all languages, keep those indexes up-to-date, and efficiently resolve code intelligence queries against all indexed code.

## Tech stack

Go, TypeScript, Postgres and many other languages for supporting LSIF and LSP.
