# Code Intelligence goals and priorities

## Goals

### Expand language support and adoption of precise code intelligence

Progress on adoption and usage is tracked in our [Looker dashboard](https://sourcegraph.looker.com/dashboards/131).

**Problem:**

- Adoption of precise code intelligence comes with a cost. This cost often exceeds a customers's expectation of the benefits precise code intelligence would provide to their organization. We therefore have low adoption in both private instances and Sourcegraph Cloud.
- There is no large open source corpus to demonstrate the benefit of precise code intelligence when adopted at scale.
- Direct delivery to customers prior to having a large, working sample of repositories is difficult as we don't know what issues are caused by our tooling, and what issues are caused by non-standard build configurations.

**Outcome:**

- 25 popular open source C++ repositories are indexed on Sourcegraph Cloud.
- 25 popular open source Java repositories are indexed on Sourcegraph Cloud.
- C++ and Java indexers are adopted by at least 3 customers each.
- Precise code intel reaches [*N<sub>0</sub>*][N0] precise code intel operations a month.
- CE and Sales have a significant amount of open source repos to showcase and can easily demonstrate the value of setting up precise code intelligence.
- For languages that are particularly subject to unusual setups and tooling, our indexed open source showcase helps us determine if setup issues are caused by an unusual customer dev environment.

**Milestones:**

1. ðŸ”„ Sourcegraph Cloud has up-to-date precise code intelligence for C++ repositories.
    - ðŸ”„ Improve stability and observability in lsif-clang
