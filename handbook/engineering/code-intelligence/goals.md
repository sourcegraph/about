# Code Intelligence goals and priorities

## Goals

### Grow LSIF adoption and usage reaching [*N<sub>0</sub>*][N0] precise code intel operations a month

Progress on adoption and usage is tracked in our [Looker dashboard](https://sourcegraph.looker.com/dashboards/131).

**Problem:** By default, users get basic code intel results which are often incorrect for tokens with common names (such as Get). This is solved by enabling precise code intel, which gives users faster, 100% accurate results for a definition or reference for a symbol they hover over. 

**Outcome:** 

- Users on Sourcegraph Cloud get precise code intelligence results for the most popular repos in each of the languages we support.
- CE and Sales have a significant amount of open source repos to showcase and can easily demonstrate the value of setting up precise code intelligence. 
- Customers are able to easily set up precise code intel for our supported languages. 
- For languages that are particularly subject to unusual setups and tooling, our indexed open source showcase helps us determine if setup issues are caused by an unusual customer dev environment.
- Nx popular open source repos are indexed on Sourcegraph Cloud.
- Precise code intel reaches N0 precise code intel operations a month. 

**Milestones:**

1. ðŸ”„ Deliver precise Go code intelligence to 3 organizations.
    - âœ… Deliver to [*N<sub>1</sub>*][N1]
    - ðŸ”„ Deliver to [*N<sub>2</sub>*][N2]
    - Deliver to [*N<sub>3</sub>*][N3]
