## Walkthrough video

This ~1h two-part screencast by @slimsag walks through this whole upgrade process end-to-end, talks about some of the intricacies, future improvements to this process, and more. It is rough / on-the-spot so please disregard the brief and occassional üê± meows and crashing noises in the background.

**Note:** You do not need to watch the above videos to perform this process, these are for educational purposes only. The steps below may be more up-to-date and accurate than the videos above.

## 0) Setup

Managed instances configuration is tracked in [`deploy-sourcegraph-managed`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-managed) - make sure you have the latest revision of this repository checked out. For basic operations like accessing an instance for these steps, see [managed instances operations](operations.md).

First, ensure you have the prerequisites installed and up-to-date:

- [Terraform CLI](https://www.terraform.io/)
- [Deno CLI](https://deno.land/) (used for scripting upgrades)
- [Comby CLI](https://comby.dev/) (used for rewriting configuration)
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)

Many of the following commands in this guide, as well as the commands [operations](./operations.md), use environment variables. Export the appropriate values for the upgrade so you don't lose track:

```sh
# name of customer deployment (should match folder)
export CUSTOMER=<customer_or_instance_name>
# version to upgrade to - MUST be in format 'v$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH'
export NEW_VERSION=v<sourcegraph_version>
# for API access to port-forwarded frontend
export SRC_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4444
# see 1password "$CUSTOMER admin account", under "token" field
export SRC_ACCESS_TOKEN=$TOKEN
```

Figure out [what instance is currently live](./operations.md#redblack-deployment-model) for the managed instance you are upgrading - it should be either `red` or `black`:

```sh
gcloud compute instances list --project=sourcegraph-managed-${CUSTOMER} | awk 'NR>1 { if ($1 ~ "-red-") print "red"; else print "black"; }'
```

Export the following values in your shell based on the above:

```sh
export OLD_DEPLOYMENT=$(gcloud compute instances list --project=sourcegraph-managed-${CUSTOMER} | awk 'NR>1 { if ($1 ~ "-red-") print "red"; else print "black"; }')
export NEW_DEPLOYMENT=$([ "$OLD_DEPLOYMENT" = "red" ] && echo "black" || echo "red")
# old version used to verify upgrade
export OLD_VERSION=$(cat ${CUSTOMER}\/${OLD_DEPLOYMENT}\/VERSION)
```

Make sure your copy of the [`deploy-sourcegraph-managed`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-managed) repository is up to date:

```sh
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

Validate all variables are set:

```sh
./util/validate-env.ts
```

Make sure to use the same shell for all the commands in this guide unless otherwise stated.

Now start a branch for your upgrade:

```sh
git checkout -b $CUSTOMER/upgrade-to-$NEW_VERSION
# all the below steps are documented assuming you are in the customer deployment directory
cd $CUSTOMER
```

## 1) Add a banner indicating scheduled maintenance is in progress

Set up access to the frontend by copying this output and running it in another shell:

```sh
echo "gcloud compute start-iap-tunnel default-$OLD_DEPLOYMENT-instance 80 --local-host-port=localhost:4444 --zone us-central1-f --project sourcegraph-managed-$CUSTOMER"
```

Check that `src` access is set up correctly:

```sh
src login
```

Note that an upgrade is being performed:

```sh
../util/set-notice.sh upgrade
```

## 2) Mark the database as ready-only

```sh
../util/set-db-readonly.sh $OLD_DEPLOYMENT true
```

During this time searching will still work, but the site will refuse all database writes, e.g. this will show up in the web UI as:

> [...]: pq: cannot execute INSERT in a read-only transaction

During this time:

- Repositories will not update
- Authentication permissions will not synchronize
- LSIF precise code intel cannot be uploaded
- User settings and site configuration cannot be updated
- Extensions cannot be installed

## 3) Create a snapshot of the current deployment

```sh
../util/create-snapshot.ts $OLD_DEPLOYMENT
git add . && git commit -m "$CUSTOMER: snapshot deployment"
```

This can take anywhere from a minute to several minutes, depending on how large the disk is.

Note the number of snapshots in `terraform.tfvars`, and prune snapshots >5 upgrades old where appropriate.
Make sure to `terraform apply` any additional changes you make.

## 4) Initialize the new production deployment

Copy the old deployment's Docker Compose configuration:

```sh
cp -R $OLD_DEPLOYMENT/ $NEW_DEPLOYMENT/
git add $NEW_DEPLOYMENT/ && git commit -m "$CUSTOMER: set up $NEW_DEPLOYMENT configuration"
```

Initialize the new production deployment (`NEW_DEPLOYMENT`) using the snapshot created in the previous step.
This should only modify the deployment - not recreate it.

```sh
../util/init-deployment.ts $NEW_DEPLOYMENT
git add . && git commit -m "$CUSTOMER: init $NEW_DEPLOYMENT deployment"
```

## 5) Make the database on the new deployment writable

Make the database on the new deployment writable:

```sh
../util/set-db-readonly.sh $NEW_DEPLOYMENT false
```

If you run into errors like:

- `bash: docker: command not found`
- `ERROR: (gcloud.beta.compute.start-iap-tunnel) Error while connecting [4003: 'failed to connect to backend'].`

This might indicate that the instance is not fully set up yet - try again in a minute.

## 6) Upgrade the new deployment

First check that thew new version requires no manual migration steps in [docker-compose upgrade guide](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/updates/docker_compose)

Then, to upgrade the new `$NEW_DEPLOYMENT` deployment to `$NEW_VERSION`:

```sh
VERSION=$NEW_VERSION ../util/update-docker-compose.sh $NEW_DEPLOYMENT/
git --no-pager diff $NEW_DEPLOYMENT
```

Address any merge conflicts in the `$NEW_DEPLOYMENT/` directory if needed.

Also verify that no references remain for the old version - the script does not automatically apply changes to replicas.
For each reference, ensure that the _entire_ service entry is up to date (i.e. not just the version).
You can list references like so (if nothing shows up, you should be good to go):

```sh
cat $NEW_DEPLOYMENT/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml | grep ${OLD_VERSION#v}
```

Commit and apply the upgrade:

```sh
git add $NEW_DEPLOYMENT/ && git commit -m "$CUSTOMER: upgrade to $NEW_VERSION"
terraform apply
```

## 7) Recreate the deployment

Take down the new `$NEW_DEPLOYMENT` deployment and recreate it (so the startup script runs on a clean OS disk):

```sh
../util/drop-deployment.ts $NEW_DEPLOYMENT
git add . && git commit -m "$CUSTOMER: take down $NEW_DEPLOYMENT"
../util/deploy-deployment.ts $NEW_DEPLOYMENT
git add . && git commit -m "$CUSTOMER: restart $NEW_DEPLOYMENT"
```

## 8) Confirm instance health

Access Grafana and confirm the instance is healthy by verifying no critical alerts are firing, and there has been no large increase in warning alerts:

```sh
gcloud compute start-iap-tunnel default-$NEW_DEPLOYMENT-instance 3370 --local-host-port=localhost:4445 --zone us-central1-f --project sourcegraph-managed-$CUSTOMER
```

If you run into an error like:

```
ERROR: (gcloud.beta.compute.start-iap-tunnel) Error while connecting [4003: 'failed to connect to backend'].
```

This might indicate that the instance is not fully set up yet - try again in a minute.

## 9) Switch the load balancer target

Connect to the new instance using the SOCKS5 proxy and confirm you can access it and view the old version at https://company.sourcegraph.com/site-admin/updates.
Switch over the load balancer:

```sh
../util/retarget-load-balancer.ts $NEW_DEPLOYMENT
git add . && git commit -m "$CUSTOMER: switch load balancer to new target"
```

During this time users will see 500 errors:

> Error: Server Error
> The server encountered a temporary error and could not complete your request.
> Please try again in 30 seconds.

For 1m35s while the `google_compute_network_endpoint` gets destroyed.

## 10) Remove the banner indicating scheduled maintenance is in progress

Set up access to new frontend by copying this output and running it in another shell:

```sh
echo "gcloud compute start-iap-tunnel default-$NEW_DEPLOYMENT-instance 80 --local-host-port=localhost:4444 --zone us-central1-f --project sourcegraph-managed-$CUSTOMER"
```

Ensure that no containers are running from the previous deployment

```sh
gcloud beta compute ssh --zone "us-central1-f" --tunnel-through-iap --project "sourcegraph-managed-${CUSTOMER}" --command "docker ps --format {{.Image}} | grep ${OLD_VERSION#v}" root@default-${NEW_DEPLOYMENT}-instance
```

Check that `src` access is set up correctly:

```sh
src login
```

Remove the notice previously added to the global user settings:

```sh
../util/set-notice.sh none
```

## 11) Take down the old deployment

Remove the old `$OLD_DEPLOYMENT` deployment and its data disk:

```sh
../util/drop-deployment.ts $OLD_DEPLOYMENT drop-disk
rm -rf $OLD_DEPLOYMENT/
git add . && git commit -m "$CUSTOMER: remove $OLD_DEPLOYMENT deployment"
```

## 13) Open a pull request to commit your changes

```sh
git push origin HEAD
```

And click the provided link to open a pull request in [`deploy-sourcegraph-managed`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-managed).

**IMPORTANT: DO NOT FORGET TO GET YOUR PR APPROVED AND MERGED**, if you forget then the next person upgrading the instance will have a very bad time.
