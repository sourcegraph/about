# Creating a managed instance

Creating a new managed instance involves following the steps below.

1. Ask @stephen or @beyang to create a new GCP project `sourcegraph-managed-$COMPANY` and grant you IAM **Editor** role access.
1. Ask @beyang to enable billing in the GCP project.
1. Create GCP service account credentials:
    - From console.cloud.google.com select the project > **APIs & Services** > **Credentials** > **Create credentials** > **Service account**
    - Service account name: `deploy`
    - Service account description: blank
    - On the **Service account permissions (optional)** page add the **Compute Admin**, **Storage admin**.
    - **Done** > ignore **Grant users access to this service account (optional)** and choose **Done**
    - Select **Edit** (pencil) on the service account we just created
    - **Add key** > **Create new key** > **JSON** > **Create**
1. Upload the service account key and create admin credentials in 1password:
    - Open the 1password [Managed instances vault](https://my.1password.com/vaults/l35e5xtcfsk5suuj4vfj76hqpy/allitems) (ask @stephen, @gonza, or @beyang to grant you access)
    - **Add** > **Document** > enter **$COMPANY service account** as the title > Upload the service account JSON  file previously downloaded > **Save**
    - **Add** > **Password** > enter **$COMPANY sourcegraph-admin** as the title > Change **length** to 40 and turn on symbols and digits >> **Save**
1. In GCP, enable the **Compute Engine API**:
   - Under **APIs & Services** > **Library** search for "Compute"
   - Select **Compute Engine API** and choose **Enable**
1. `export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=~/Downloads/sourcegraph-managed-company-220df65550d4.json`
1. Clone and `cd deploy-sourcegraph-managed/`
1. `VERSION=v3.17.2 ./create-deployment.sh $COMPANY/` and **commit the result.**
1. Open and edit `deploy-sourcegraph-managed/$COMPANY/gcp-tfstate/gcp-tfstate.tf` according to the comments within, commit the result.
1. In `gcp-tfstate` run `terraform init && terraform apply && git add . && git commit -m 'initialize GCP tfstate bucket'`
1. Open and edit `infrastructure.tf` according to the comments within and commit the result.
1. In `deploy-sourcegraph-managed/$COMPANY` run `terraform init && terraform plan && terraform apply`
1. Access the instance over SSH and confirm all containers are healthy (instructions below).
1. In the infrastructure repository, [create a DNS entry](https://github.com/sourcegraph/infrastructure/blob/master/dns/sourcegraph-managed.tf) that points `$COMPANY.sourcegraph.com` to the `default-global-address` IP (see "Finding the external load balancer IP" below) and follow the process there to `asdf exec terraform apply` it.
1. Confirm all containers come up healthy (`docker ps` should report them as such)
1. Create a PR for review.
1. Access the Sourcegraph web UI (instructions for port-forwarding below)
1. Navigate to Grafana and confirm the instance looks healthy.
1. Set up the initial admin account (for use by the Sourcegraph team only)
   - Email: `managed+$COMPANY@sourcegraph.com` (note `+` sign not `-`)
   - Username: `sourcegraph-admin`
   - Password: Use the password previously created and stored in 1password.
1. Configure `externalURL` in the site configuration, and use SSH to restart the server (`sudo su`, `shutdown -r`) wait for it to come back up and access it again.
1. In the global user settings, set `"alerts.showPatchUpdates": false`
1. In the GCP web UI under **Network services** > **Load balancers** > select the load balancer > watch the SSL certificate status. It may take some time for it to become active (~1h41m) / for Google to see the DNS change from Cloudflare. Confirm it is active by following ["Access through the GCP load balancer as a user would"](#access-through-the-gcp-load-balancer-as-a-user-would).
1. In the site configuration, configure alerting to go to our `#alerts-managed-instances` Slack channel, for example (replace `$COMPANY` with the actual company name, and `$WEBHOOK_URL` with the actual webhook URL from 1password **Managed instances** > `#alerts-managed-instances Slack webhook URL`):

```
	"observability.alerts": [
		{
			"level": "critical",
			"notifier": {
				"type": "slack",
				"username": "$COMPANY",
				"url": "$WEBHOOK_URL"
			}
		},
		{
			"level": "warning",
			"notifier": {
				"type": "slack",
				"username": "$COMPANY",
				"url": "$WEBHOOK_URL"
			}
		}
	],
```
