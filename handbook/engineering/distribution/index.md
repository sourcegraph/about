# Distribution team

The distribution team is responsible for making Sourcegraph easy to deploy, scale, monitor, and debug. We solve challenging problems that our customers face when they deploy and scale Sourcegraph on-premise in a variety of environments, and that we face when we deploy and scale [Sourcegraph.com](https://sourcegraph.com/search) (the largest Sourcegraph installation in the world).

## Ownership areas

The following is a breakdown of the areas of Sourcegraph that the Distribution team owns. It aims to be 100% comprehensive, but the owners are merely aspirational goal posts, not mandates. At the end of the day, whoever has most context will own the area.
