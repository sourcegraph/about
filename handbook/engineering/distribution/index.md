# Distribution team

<img align="right" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/92966535-955f2380-f42c-11ea-8723-2aa60c55b2db.png" height="500px" alt="Sourcegraph Distribution team logo"></img>

The distribution team is responsible for making Sourcegraph easy to deploy, scale, monitor, and debug. We solve the most challenging problems our customers face deploying Sourcegraph on-premise in a variety of environments, and on [Sourcegraph.com](https://sourcegraph.com/search) - the largest Sourcegraph instance in the world.

## Contact

- Slack: #distributioneers channel or @distribution
- For support requests, please use our dedicated [support rotation](#support-rotation)
- File issues: [team/distribution](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/new?labels=team/distribution) label

## Team communication

Our team has two Slack channels, one public (#distributioneers) and one private (#distribution-team). **Our default is to use the public channel**. The #distribution-team channel will only be used for discussing internal team topics, like scheduling, retrospectives, how we do updates, etc.

## Incident on-call rotation

Who is on-call? Slack: `/genie whoisoncall Distribution`

We have a 24x7 OpsGenie rotation to respond to [incidents](../incidents/index.md) (events that cause service disruption). You can find more information about [being on-call in the handbook](../incidents/on_call.md).

**Incidents on-call**

- [Alerts owned by this team](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=repo:%5Egithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24+file:monitoring/.*+%7B:%5B_%5D%2C+Owner:+monitoring.ObservableOwnerDistribution%2C+:%5B_%5D%7D+OR+%28:%5B_%5D%2C+monitoring.ObservableOwnerDistribution%29+count:1000&patternType=structural)

## Support rotation

Who is on-call? Slack: `/genie whoisoncall distribution-support`

_You can directly notify the on-call support engineer by using the handle `@distribution-support`._

We maintain a support rotation to deal day-to-day requests (respond to ad-hoc, time-sensitive questions from customers or other teams, RFC review requests, etc). This makes it easier for other teams to reach out an engineer on the team whose priority is being the point of contact for these questions. You can read more about this on the references below.
When you are the active support engineer, your focus and priority is responding to requests and questions in #distributioneers, sometimes this might require creating an issue, re-assigning, looping in other engineers, etc.

_If for any reason you are unavailable for a rotation, please coordinate with the team for someone to take over._

**Resonsibilities**:

The on-call support engineer is responsbile for owning the communication and determining the relative priority of the issue. However, the on-call engineer is **not expected** to solve issues entirely on their own (in fact, it's encouraged to pull in the other engineers if necessary - to bounce ideas off of one another, someone else might have more expertise in this particular area, etc.).

**References:**

### Contacting the support engineer

There are many reasons to contact the support engineer depending on the priority or urgency of a request.
Here are some guidelines that will help ensure we can reply to your request appropriately.

#### General questions

Send us a message in #distributioneers and notify the active engineer by `@distribution-support` in the message.
Alternatively `@distribution-support` the engineer in the thread in which he is required.
If this is a **time sensitive request**, please let us know in the message that this is the case

#### Customer incidents

You can send an urgent notification to the engineer directly from Slack utilizing the following command: `/genie alert "ce/p1: Customer XYZ systems are impaired #12345" for distribution-support`.
If the engineer is unable, a message will be send to the rest of the team.

Please provide a link to an [issue](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/ce/customer_issues) in the message.
