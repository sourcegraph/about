## 2020

### FY-20-Q4

#### Automatic e2e testing

[RFC 137](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14f7lwfToeT6t_vxnGsCuXqf3QcB5GRZ2Zoy6kYqBAIQ/edit#heading=h.trqab8y0kufp) saw us remove our e2e tests from CI entirely because it was unreliable. Now e2e tests are run as part of our monthly release process completely manually, and are heavily broken/outdated each time we attempt to do it. Fixing them often takes ~1.5d of work from a developer on the team. Per the RFC, we want to run these e2e tests on CI in an automated and reliable fashion.

#### CI infrastructure that can run Docker containers in a reliable way

Today we cannot release of Sourcegraph, run e2e tests, or perform Docker image tests in an automated fashion because our CI infrastructure does not support running Docker containers (or VMs/Vagrant) in a reliable way. We have a [side-car DIND container in our CI pipeline](https://k8s.sgdev.org/search?q=repo:sourcegraph/infrastructure%24+dind&patternType=literal) but it is flaky, unreliable, and a regular source of issues which has led to us removing automated testing (see [Automatic e2e testing](#automatic-e2e-testing)).

#### Support customers in deploying Sourcegraph with 500k+ repositories

We have had customers interested in deploying Sourcegraph at large-scale with ~500k+ repositories and will need to dedicate time to supporting them and making their trial go smoothly.

### FY-20-Q3

#### Docker-compose should be released on-time (on the 20th)

Docker-compose deployments were never properly integrated into our release process, and as such it has been released late by about one week after the official release date of 20th when the blog post announcement goes live. This has happened for the past ~4 releases. This has been a recurring problem for customers ("I can't upgrade it doesn't seem to be released"), which has increased support load, and has been a recurring worry from the CE team and others ("can I tell this customer to upgrade to fix their issue yet?").

#### Add monitoring for common critical issues

While Sourcegraph does have built-in monitoring that is well-defined and works generally well, there are large gaps in several areas for common critical issues such as repositories failing to clone, repositories being deleted en-mass, search indexing failing, containers/services being unreachable, and much more. We need to add monitoring for common critical issues via per-team alerting and getting widespread adoption of standardized alerting internally at Sourcegraph.

#### GitOps / Terraform for all internal infrastructure

Today much of our internal infrastructure is managed directly instead of through GitOps / Terraform. It is common to require manual changes or interaction with the cluster to perform ops duties. We want to move to a world where all Sourcegraph internal infrastructure (CI pipelines, Sourcegraph.com, etc.) is managed by Git Ops, and all changes have review using a Git workflow.

#### All site admins should have alerting set up to be notified when Sourcegraph is unhealthy

We have standardized alerting across our deployment methods, but it is very difficult to set up. Make it easy enough that all site admins can configure alerting and get notified when Sourcegraph is unhealthy.
