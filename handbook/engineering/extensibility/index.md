# Extensibility team

**The extensibility team does not yet exist**. It is a team we want to create & grow. Responsibilities of the extensibility team are currently owned by the [web team](../web/index.md).

## Vision

**Sourcegraph extensions** empower users to integrate Sourcegraph with any third-party service providing useful information about code (code coverage, exception tracking, tracing, code quality). They are consistently supported across all code host integrations and the Sourcegraph UI. Through extensions, Sourcegraph surfaces high-level [**code insights**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EHzor6I1GhVVIpl70mH-c10b1tNEl_p1xRMJ9qHQfoc/edit) to engineering leaders, empowering data-driven decisions.
