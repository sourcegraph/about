# Code reviews

All code should be reviewed and approved by an appropriate teammate before being merged into the `master` branch.

Our goal is to have a code review process and culture that everyone would opt-in to even if code reviews weren't required.

## Why do we require peer code reviews?

Code reviews are an investment. As an author, it takes extra time and effort to create good PRs, wait for someone to review your code, and address review comments. As a code reviewer, it takes extra time to understand the motivation, design, and implementation of someone else's code so that you can provide valuable feedback. This investment is worth it because it provides benefits to every person on the team and it helps the team as a whole ship features to our customers that are _high quality_ and _maintainable_.

For authors:

- Requesting a code review from one of your peers is motivation to ensure that the quality of your code is high.
- Writing a good PR description (and commit messages) develops your technical communication skills.
- Receiving code review feedback can give you valuable insight into aspects of your change that you hadn't considered (architectural, performance, etc).
- Receiving feedback about how your code could be improved helps you learn how to write better code in the future.

For reviewers:

- Reviewing code from others increases your code literacy and empathy. You will learn new things from how your peers write code and you will be more aware of how to write code that is easier for your reviewers to understand.
- Reading PR descriptions increases your technical literacy and empathy. You will learn what makes a PR description effective and you will be more aware of how to write PR descriptions that are easier for your reviewers to understand.
- Being a reviewer gives you the ability to share knowledge you have that others do not. Every person, regardless of experience level, has both something to learn and something to contribute.

For the team:

- Code reviews increase the overall quality of our codebase by catching design and implementation defects before changes ship to customers.
- Code reviews increase the overall consistency of our codebase by spreading knowledge of best practices and eliminating anti-patterns.
- Code reviews distribute domain expertise, code knowledge, and ownership across the team so development can continue when people are unavailable (e.g. vacation).

## Review cycles

Once a change is ready for review it may go through a few review cycles, in general it'll look something like this:

1. Ready for review
1. Reviewers leave feedback
1. Author addresses feedback, ensuring they have marked each comment as resolved. This can be relaxed if a comment was just a suggestion or a small nit. The goal is to communicate to the reviewer what has changed since they last reviewed.
1. Author leaves a comment letting the reviewers know it is ready for another pass. Back to step 1.

## When is a code review not required?

We do not technically prevent PRs from being merged before being explicitly approved because there exist PRs that are appropriate to merge without waiting for a review.

Some examples:

- Reverting a previous change to solve a production issue.
- Minor documentation changes.
- Auto-generated changes, such as when performing a version release, where a reviewer would not have anything of substance to review.

It should be obvious to any other engineer on the team from the PR description and/or diff that it was appropriate for you to not wait for approval.

Here are some examples of reasons to skip code review that are NOT acceptable:

- "I promised that I would ship this to $CUSTOMER by $DEADLINE"
  - The customer expects the feature to work and be maintained. Code review helps ensure both of these things by increasing the quality and distributing ownership.
- "This code is experimental"
  - Our goal is to have a code review culture such that engineers who are working on "experimental" code still find code reviews valuable and worth doing (for all the benefits mentioned in the rest of this document).
  - All code that is in `master` has the potential to impact customers (e.g. by causing a bug) and other developers at Sourcegraph (e.g. by making it harder to refactor code). As such, it is in our interest to ensure a certain quality level on all code whether or not it is considered "experimental".
  - Assume that we allowed "experimental" code to bypass code review. How would we know when it is no longer experimental and how would it get reviewed? Either it wouldn't get reviewed, or an engineer would have to review all the code after the fact without a nice PR diff to look at or effective way to make comments. Neither of these outcomes would meet our need of reviewing all non-experimental code.
- "I don't have someone to review this code"
  - Ask for help to identify someone else on the team with whom you can share your knowledge, context, and ownership.

If we see that there are too many [PRs being merged without approval](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+org%3Asourcegraph+is%3Amerged+review%3Anone+-author%3Aapp%2Frenovate&utf8=%E2%9C%93) that lack an appropriate reason, then we will have to consider an automated solution to enforce code reviews.

## What makes an effective Pull Request (PR)?

An effective PR minimizes the amount of effort that is required for the reviewer to understand your change so that they can provide high quality feedback in a timely manner. [Further reading](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/git/written-unwritten-guide-pull-requests).

Do:

- Prefer small PRs. If a large PR is unavoidable, try to organize it into smaller commits (with [good commit messages](commit_messages.md)) that are reviewable independently (and indicate this to the reviewer in the description).
- Create a draft PR first and review your own diff as if you were reviewing someone else's change. This helps you empathize with your reviewer and can help catch silly mistakes before your reviewer sees them (e.g. forgetting to `git add` a file, forgetting to remove debugging code, etc.).
- Create meaningful PR title and description that communicates **what** the PR does and **why** (the **how** is the diff).
  - Include links to relevant issues (e.g. "closes #1234", "helps #5678").
  - Include a screenshot, GIF, or video if you are making user facing changes.
  - Discuss alternative implementations that you considered but didn't pursue (and why).
  - Describe any remaining open questions that you are seeking feedback on.
- Make it clear who's review(s) you are waiting for.
- Politely remind your reviewer that you are waiting for a review if they haven't responded after one business day.
- If you need to work on your PR after a first round of reviews, try not to force push commits that erase the latest reviewed commit or any commit prior to that. This makes it easy for reviewers to pick up where they left off in the previous round.

## What makes an effective code review?

Please read:

- [On code reviews](https://medium.com/@schrockn/on-code-reviews-b1c7c94d868c)
- [Code Health: Respectful Reviews == Useful Reviews](https://testing.googleblog.com/2019/11/code-health-respectful-reviews-useful.html)

The code author and code reviewer have a _shared goal_ to bring the PR into a state that meets our quality standards and the needs that motivated the change.

Do:

- Take time to understand the context and goal of the PR. If it isn't clear, ask for clarification.
- Acknowledge what the author did well to balance the tone of the review.
- Make it clear which comments are blocking your explicit approval (e.g. use "nit:" prefix for minor comments) and approve if all of your comments are minor.
- If the author were to address all of your comments faithfully and you would be content, then you should also approve to avoid the author needing to wait for a subsequent review without reason (exception: you asked for fundamental or vast/large changes and believe those will need re-review by you).
- When you are making comments on a PR, use a tone that is kind, empathetic, collaborative, and humble. [Further reading](https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews-1/).

Don't:

- Comment on the details of the PR if you have questions or concerns about the overall direction or design. The former will distract from the latter and might be irrelevant if the PR is reworked.
- Take longer than one business day to respond to a PR that is ready for your review (or re-review).
- Have protracted discussions in PR comments. If it can't be settled quickly in a few review round trips, try discussing in person or on a video call because these mediums are higher bandwidth and encourage empathy. Then summarize the results in the PR discussion after the fact.

## GitHub notifications

Ensure that you have you [GitHub notification settings](github-notifications/index.md) configured correctly so that you are responsive to comments on PRs that you have authored and to review requests from teammates.

## Who should I get a code review from?

You should get a code review from the person who's approval will give you the most confidence that your change is high quality. If you are modifying existing code, you can use `git blame` to identify the previous author and the previous reviewer because they probably will have helpful context.

If your change touches multiple parts of our codebase (e.g. Go, TypeScript), then you will need to get approval from multiple peers (e.g. a Go reviewer and a TypeScript reviewer).

GitHub will automatically assign reviewers if there is a matching entry in the [CODEOWNERS](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/blob/.github/CODEOWNERS) file, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you need to wait for an approval from everyone. For example, if you are making a change to the search backend then you only need approval from one person on that team, not all of them.

Use your best judgement and ask if you are uncertain.

## When should I use a draft PR?

A draft PR signals that the change is not ready for reviewed. This is useful, for example, if you want to self-review your diff before sending review requests to others. If you are looking for feedback or discussion on your change, then you should mark the PR as ready for review and communicate your intentions in the PR description.

## Security

Special care should be taken when reviewing a diff that contains, or is adjacent to, comments that contain the following string: `ðŸš¨ SECURITY`. These comments indicate security-sensitive code, the correctness of which is necessary to ensure that no private data is accessed by unauthorized actors. The code owner of any modified security-sensitive code must approve the changeset before it is merged.
