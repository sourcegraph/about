# Engineering Manager - Code Intelligence

We are looking for an engineering manager to lead our team that is building the semantic graph of code. The team's mission is to build a code intelligence platform that understands code in all languages and provides rich metadata to power the rest of Sourcegraph, including code search, insights, and campaigns. Read the [code intelligence team handbook documentation](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/engineering/code-intelligence) to learn more.

## About you

- You know how to authentically inspire, challenge, and grow individuals and teams.
- You are motivated to work on ambitious long term goals to solve complex technical challenges.
- You are [high agency](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/high-agency-its-importance-how-cultivate-shreyas-doshi/).

## Your responsibilities

- You will facilitate a cohesive team environment where everyone is happy, motivated, and productive.
- You will ensure that the team has [well defined goals that are aligned with the business](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/engineering/code-intelligence#goals) that are effectively communicated to all levels of the company, and that the team is making continuous iterative progress towards those goals every week.
- You will help engineers grow in their careers.
- You will hire exceptional engineers to grow the team (from 3 to ~6-8 engineers) in a sustainable way so that the team can accomplish more over time.

## Qualifications

- You have 2+ years of experience directly managing at least 3 full-time software engineers. We expect you already know how to lead a team.
- You have done some amount of coding in the past 2 years (for example: at work or on a personal project) to keep your skills up-to-date. We expect that you are able to review and provide valuable feedback on code, architecture, and designs.
- You are able to clearly communicate your past accomplishments verbally (example: in an interview) and in writing (examples: in your resume, in your answers to our application questions).
- You have lead a team that has successfully shipped a product to (ideally enterprise) customers.
- You have experience working with multiple programming languages and their ecosystems (e.g., tooling, communities), and are interested and curious to engage with languages that you aren't yet familiar with.
- You have experience breaking up complex technical problems into smaller achievable milestones that the team can iterate on.

## Nice to haves

- You have experience designing, architecting, scaling, and optimizing systems that span multiple layers of a tech stack (example: frontend, backend, CLI).
- You have grown at least one junior engineer to a senior+ level.
- You have designed a software engineer interview process from first principles.
- You have built and delivered an application that works on multiple platforms (examples: different operating systems, cloud versus on-premise)
