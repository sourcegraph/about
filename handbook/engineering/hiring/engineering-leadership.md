# Engineering leadership

This interview is performed by the hiring manager and one peer manager.

There are more questions here than can possibly be answered in one interview. Your goal is to touch on most of these topics and go deep on a few.

With great candidates, the conversation will unfold very naturally and you will ask contextual followup questions. Once you are satisfied (or have spent sufficient time to know you won't be satisfied), move on to another topic instead of rigidly sticking to the script.

Questions:

- Describe in your own words what the job of an engineering manager is.
