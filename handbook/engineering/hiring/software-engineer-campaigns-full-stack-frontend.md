# Software Engineer — Campaigns — Full Stack / Frontend

The Campaigns team is looking for an experienced engineer to help us build a new product that will define how our industry accomplishes large scale code changes. [Campaigns](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/campaigns) enable developers to make changes across many repositories and code hosts, using code.

We’re a [small, autonomous, international, full stack team](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/engineering/campaigns). So we contribute in a lot of different ways: frontend/backend coding, technical writing, QA, supporting our customers, and working closely with Product and Design. If it matters to our users, then it’s part of the job.

We work together, laugh a lot, and are always learning.

## Why this job is interesting

- Campaigns solve a very real and painful problem that our customers want solved. Our team is totally focused on this concrete need. Since our customers provide ample feedback and are eager to test new features, continuously shipping to provide them value is highly rewarding.
- We’re in the early stages of creating this product, and have a lot of [autonomy and agency](https://about.sourcegraph.com/company/values#high-agency). As a result, we all have significant impact on the shape and direction of Campaigns. We can see our own fingerprints all over, making it all the more delightful when customers love our work.
- We have all sorts of interesting challenges and opportunities for growth. Frontend and backend coding, architecture and design, authoring RFCs, testing, demoing to customers, collecting and incorporating feedback, supporting our customers… we do it all.
- Our technical challenges are varied and fun: from [git diff parsing](https://github.com/sourcegraph/go-diff) to [TypeScript](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/tree/client/web/src/enterprise/campaigns), to [efficiently querying REST/GraphQL APIs](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/blob/enterprise/internal/campaigns/syncer.go) without overloading a code host, to building a “declarative distributed system” that [reconciles state across code hosts](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph@963d99f52a0c366e6481336f1b0314ed80e0663d/-/blob/enterprise/internal/campaigns/reconciler.go#L133-203), to designing [the DSL that is our campaign spec](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/campaigns/references/campaign_spec_yaml_reference), to [building terminal emulation into our tests](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli@a1721db3a205dad52b1bde7b9a2d21479c9ccba8/-/blob/cmd/src/campaign_progress_printer_test.go#L119-187), it does not get dull around here.
- We are still at the beginning of this journey, with so much cool work in front of us: better changeset sorting/filtering/management, automated labels/reviewers/merging, bringing the power of campaigns to monorepos, server-side execution, and more. And there are many more exciting ideas on our [roadmap](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/engineering/campaigns/goals#roadmap)!
- We’re a team full of funny, highly-skilled, empathetic developers who are all great communicators. Especially the manager, who is just all-around wonderful (and, it should be noted, is the one writing this).

## What we need from you

We are looking for a full-stack engineer (or a frontend engineer with full-stack aspirations, eager to learn) who has strong fundamentals in good software development techniques and best practices, and who has built and deployed production-ready software that delivered value to customers.

Most of all, we’re looking for an engineer with whole-product concern and accountability. Someone who understands that success is measured by our customers, and that everything that impacts customer satisfaction is part of your job. If working directly with sales, marketing, support, and our customers feels like “that’s not my job,” then this is not your job. On the other hand, if you’ve shipped a product, beginning to end (for work or on the side, software or otherwise), we want to hear from you.

Beyond that, we’re looking for the following:

- Experience creating single page applications using React or similar component-based frontend frameworks.
- Skilled at writing clean, reusable CSS and semantic HTML to implement visual designs.
- Familiarity with TypeScript or another typed programming language.
- Experience (professional or otherwise) in at least one server side language, such as Go, Java, Python, PHP, or Ruby.
- Familiarity with HTTP and web technologies/concepts such as REST and GraphQL.
- Experience building and testing end-to-end applications (e.g. unit, integration, and e2e testing).
- Good knowledge of Git in particular and other version control systems in general.
- Able to write queries and design schemas in SQL, Postgres or other transactional, relational databases.

## Not sure if this is you?

We want a diverse, global team, with a broad range of experience and perspectives. If this job sounds great, but you’re not sure if you qualify, apply anyway! We carefully consider every application, and will either move forward with you, find another team that might be a better fit, keep in touch for future opportunities, or thank you for your time.
