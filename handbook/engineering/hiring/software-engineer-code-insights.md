# Software Engineer — Code Insights — Frontend

The code insights team is looking for an experienced, passionate engineer to build with us an entirely new product area of Sourcegraph: Code insights.
Code insights is the first feature in Sourcegraph that provides **high-level** information about code, building on top of all other features Sourcegraph already has, and even external data sources.

We're building a [small, autonomous, international, full stack team](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/engineering/code-insights).

- You will be one of the **founding engineers** for this team. As a result, you can have tons of impact on the shape and direction of code insights.
- Despite its early stage, code insights already has tons of customer validation.
- Ahead lay extremely interesting challenges and opportunities for growth in making code insights scalable to hundred thousands of repositories, while also making it more powerful with filter capabilities, actionable insights, custom data sources, and much more we haven't even thought of yet.
- Given we build on top of all the data Sourcegraph have, this team is highly collaborate across team boundaries. Your mental space will not be bound to the boundaries of this feature, rather you will need to actively think with other teams how we can tie into their features to create an overall cohesive product for our users.

- You share our [values](../../../company/values.md), and work in accordance with those values.

## Your responsibilities

- Work closely with a dedicated designer and PM to implement high-quality UIs using React, SCSS and TypeScript.
- Actively shape the direction and participate in the planning of the features we're going to build, e.g. by writing and reviewing RFCs.
- Build UIs you will love to use yourself as a developer.
- Collaborate with backend engineers to define the ideal APIs needed to deliver on the desired user experience.
- Collaborate with other product teams like search, code intelligence and campaigns to figure out integration points with other Sourcegraph features.
- Hold up accessibility standards.

## Qualifications

- Experience in writing [SPAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) using React or similar component-based frontend frameworks.
- Familiarity with TypeScript or a different typed programming language.
- Skilled at writing clean, reusable CSS and semantic HTML to implement visual designs.
- Experience in designing backend APIs (e.g. GraphQL or REST) from a client perspective.
- Experience in using backend APIs from the frontend.
- Skilled at building and testing (e.g. unit testing, automated end-to-end testing) UIs.

## Nice-to-haves

- Extensive experience with TypeScript.
- Extensive experience with GraphQL.
- Large and/or numerous contributions to open source projects.
- Published blog posts and/or tech talks about your work.
- Experience working on small high-performing product teams, preferably tech startups.
- Experience working with a global or otherwise multicultural team.
- Developer platform/tool industry experience.
- Experience specifically in the space of data visualization dashboards or similar.
