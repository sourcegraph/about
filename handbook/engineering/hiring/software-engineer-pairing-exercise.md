# Pairing exercise

We ask candidates to spend an hour pairing with an engineer on the team they are applying to. **The pairing exercise is not used for technical evaluation.** That's what the [async coding exercise](software-engineer-coding-exercise.md) is for.

## What we're looking for

- Clear explanations of ideas and decisions.
- Frequent communication while pairing.
- Willingness to drive, while the other engineer in the loop.
- Ability to let the interviewer drive while staying engaged.
- Flexibility in considering other ideas and approaches, and in making changes to the code.
- Ability to break down a problem and decide on an approach as a pair.
- Healthy responses to feedback.
