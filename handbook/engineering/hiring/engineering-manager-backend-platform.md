# Engineering Manager - Backend Platform and Cloud

We are looking for an engineering manager to lead the team that is building the backend platform that enables our product engineering teams to iterate quickly and safely. The team's mission is to create leverage for and accelerate the velocity of other engineering teams by promoting and championing consistency and simplicity across all backend code, and by building shared tools, libraries, and scalable infrastructure for common use cases.

This team is currently called our "Cloud" team because it is focused on [building and launching the first version of Sourcegraph Cloud](../cloud/goals.md#private-code-on-sourcegraph-cloud). In the short term, you will help the team balance work on Sourcegraph Cloud as well as engineering infrastructure. In the medium/long term, you will figure out how we transition to a state where we have a dedicated backend platform team while ensuring that our cloud product is sufficiently owned and maintained.

## Responsibilities

You will:

- Facilitate an inclusive and cohesive team environment where everyone is happy, motivated, and productive.
- Model, teach, and reinforce [our company values](../../../company/values.md) and [our guiding engineering principles](../index.md#guiding-principles).
- Ensure the team has clear incremental goals that are documented and are always up-to-date.
- Regularly communicate the team's progress toward their goals as well as changes in team goals to appropriate stakeholders.
- Support and coach teammates to grow in their careers and fulfill their responsibilities.
- Grow the team in a sustainable way so that the team can accomplish more over time.

## Qualifications

- You have 2+ years of experience directly managing at least 4 full-time software engineers. We expect you already know how to lead a team.
- You have done some amount of coding in the past 2 years (for example: at work or on a personal project) to keep your skills up-to-date. We expect that you are able to review and provide valuable feedback on code, architecture, and designs.
- You are able to clearly communicate your past accomplishments verbally (example: in an interview) and in writing (examples: in your resume, in your answers to our application questions).
- You have experience breaking up complex technical problems into smaller achievable milestones that the team can iterate on.
