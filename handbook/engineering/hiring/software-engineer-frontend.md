# Software Engineer - Frontend

We are looking for frontend engineers who know how to build intuitive user experiences and APIs to make the power of [Universal Code Search](https://about.sourcegraph.com/product) accessible to everyone. You will have a lot of ownership to solve tough technical and UX problems in key areas of our web application and browser extensions (e.g. code search, code navigation, campaigns).

## Qualifications

- Excellent knowledge of TypeScript.
- Solid understanding of JavaScript's concurrency model and event loop.
- Skilled at building and testing (e.g., unit testing, automated end-to-end testing) React single page applications and HTTP APIs (GraphQL and Go preferred).
- Ability to communicate clearly and empathetically, especially in writing and documentation.
- Practiced at creating high quality software balanced with a pragmatic understanding of how to make appropriate tradeoffs (e.g. cut scope) to ship quickly and iterate when necessary.

## Nice-to-haves

- Experience building extensions to browsers (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and/or editors (e.g. Visual Studio Code, Intellij, Sublime).
- Experience building intuitive and documented CLIs.
- Large and/or numerous contributions to open source projects.
- Published blog posts and/or tech talks about your work.
- Experience working on small high-performing teams, preferably tech startups.
