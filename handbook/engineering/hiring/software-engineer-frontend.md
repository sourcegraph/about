- Ensure UI/UX consistency in our app.
- Identify potential for abstraction and build components that can be reused, even by other teams.
- Improve the code patterns in our frontend.
- Hold up accessibility standards.

## Qualifications

- Experience in writing [SPAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) using React or similar component-based frontend frameworks.
- Familiarity with TypeScript or a different typed programming language.
- Skilled at writing clean, reusable CSS and semantic HTML to implement visual designs.
- Experience in using backend APIs from the frontend.
- Skilled at building and testing (e.g. unit testing, automated end-to-end testing) UIs.

## Nice-to-haves

- Extensive experience with TypeScript.

- Experience building browser extensions (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- Large and/or numerous contributions to open source projects.
- Published blog posts and/or tech talks about your work.
