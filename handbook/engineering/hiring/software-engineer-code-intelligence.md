# Software Engineer - Code intelligence

We are looking for software engineers who are passionate about language analysis and who want to work in many language ecosystems. You will design and implement ways to extract semantic information from code so that we can support fast precise code intelligence (e.g., go to definition, find references) for every language in a way that scales to the largest codebases in the world. Read the [code intelligence team handbook documentation](../code-intelligence/index.md) to learn more.

## Qualifications

- Comfortable developing, testing, and debugging backend services in TypeScript or Go.
- Experience with multiple programming languages, dependency management systems, and build systems coupled with a strong desire to learn new ones.
- Ability to communicate clearly and empathetically, especially in writing and documentation.
- Practiced at creating high quality software balanced with a pragmatic understanding of how to make appropriate tradeoffs (e.g., cut scope) to ship quickly and iterate when necessary.

## Nice-to-haves

- Experience making distributed systems observable (e.g., logging, Prometheus metrics, request tracing).
- Experience using Postgres and Redis.
- Experience load testing distributed systems.
- Experience writing high performance code and benchmarks.
- Large and/or numerous contributions to open source projects.
- Published blog posts and/or tech talks about your work.
- Experience working on small high-performing teams, preferably tech startups.
