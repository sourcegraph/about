# Web Team Goals and Priorities 

## Goals

### Long term

**_The web team has three areas of focus: creating and maintaining a highly usable and intentionally designed webapp interface; delivering the full, unique value of [extensions](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/extensions) to our users; and developing code insights into an entirely new featureset._**

**Outcome**: Our webapp, browser extensions and native integrations, and code insights all provide our users unique value. These platforms are well-maintained, well-designed, consistent, easy to setup, well-documented, well-tested, performant, and leave users impressed. The webapp helps users discover and employ the full power of Sourcegraph effectively, with a high quality and highly usable interface. The extensions and extensions API provide powerful capabilities to users and a great experience for extension developers. Code insights expose the value of code metadata to users at all levels of an organization. 

### Medium term

To reach our long-term goal, we set the following medium-term goals to guide our short-term iteration plans.

1. **Make the Sourcegraph web interfaces more consistent and improve discoverability of Sourcegraph features.**
   Our web app has accumulated a lot of design debt over time, which negatively impacts how we can use it as a vehicle to deliver extensions.
   With areas like the repository page, user settings area, navigation, settings, command palette UI and overall design affected, we want to provide the best possible UX for using Sourcegraph. 
2. **Make the browser extension and Sourcegraph extensions a core part of Sourcegraph users' experiences.**
   Our extension platform includes the workflow around creating, installing and using extensions, the API exposed to developers and its documentation.
   To grow adoption of extensions, these need to be solid and obviously useful. The extensions action bar needs to be clear and scalable, and help users discover our extensions. We want to track anonymized, general usage of extensions to determine which extensions are most successful at adding value for our users. 
   We have a powerful extension API, but we know of use cases and customer requests that could put adddional endpoints to use. 
   Extensions are much-loved by users, but the extensions registry can be difficult to discover and has room for design improvements around finding the most useful extensions and making someone excited to build their own extension. 
3. **Make insights an entirely new reason to use Sourcegraph.**
   We have a powerful amount of information about a codebase, and we want to expose metrics that let our users measure and track their own goals, whether those are migrations, code smells, security needs, cross-collaboration, or other information about code. We want to focus this project on the most pressing needs of our customers, before expanding it to cover continually more use cases. 

### Short term

Our goals for the current iteration can be found in our [iteration goals living Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n9WKjieKmd2YYkNrEsOfdmxRYUrbowLWjq05phLoQ6s/edit).

The individual tasks and progress of the current iteration can be found as GitHub issues in our [GitHub project board](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/45?fullscreen=true).

## Roadmap

1. âœ… Existing sourcegraph extensions are more discoverable ([RFC 209](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I5BMEGp3QuB81AjSzLCQwq_XJV1sXevlU0lpB4O1pj8/edit#))
1. âœ… The Sourcegraph browser extension is more discoverable and easy to congifure ([RFC 221](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19f4xleYBU1zZZdqMmXlLmFxeR-fwEpOwTOgViOFOnyo/edit))
1. âœ… Build new and improved Sourcegraph extensions to showcase the value and opportunity of extensions ([RFC 246](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HngEeLNAe7_QzVJr6UPi0Si4ZALqTzb7uonOxUiJP6g/edit))
1. ðŸ”„ Improve the Sourcegraph extensions (internal) development experience ([RFC 155](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ikrUNVe3YVbR-JpegxhjrFdmRkTGzTLcOMkKHnOyjuE/edit)) and (external) documentation
