# Web Team Goals and Priorities 

## Goals

### Long term

**_The web team has three areas of focus: creating and maintaining a highly usable and intentionally designed webapp interface; delivering the full, unique value of [extensions](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/extensions); maintaining and expanding code host integrations; and developing code insights into an entirely new featureset._**

**Outcome**: 
1. Our webapp, browser extensions and native integrations, and code insights all provide our users unique value. 
1. These platforms are well-maintained, well-designed, consistent, easy to setup, well-documented, well-tested, performant, and leave users impressed. 
1. The webapp helps users discover and employ the full power of Sourcegraph effectively, with a high quality and highly usable interface. 
1. Soucegraph extensions and extensions API provide powerful capabilities to users and a great experience for extension developers. 
1. Code insights expose the value of code metadata to users at all levels of an organization. 

### Medium term

TODO SPLIT TO 4 CATEGORIES

To reach our long-term goal, we set the following medium-term goals to guide our short-term iteration plans.

1. **Make the Sourcegraph web interfaces more consistent and improve discoverability of Sourcegraph features.**
   
   1.  Make progress on design debt throughought the web app, such as on the repository page, user settings area, navigation, settings, and command palette UI. 
   1. TODO ADD/SPLIT

2. **Make the browser extension and Sourcegraph extensions a core part of Sourcegraph users' experiences.**
   1. To grow adoption of extensions, build new API endpoints that are robust and obviously useful. 
   1. The extensions action bar needs to be clear and scalable, and help users discover our extensions. 
   1. We want to track anonymized, general usage of extensions to determine which extensions are most successful at adding value for our users. 
   1. Improve discoverability and design of the extension registry to enable users to find the most useful extensions and make users excited to build their own extension. 

3. **Make insights an entirely new reason to use Sourcegraph.**
   1. We want to expose metrics that let our users measure and track their own goals, whether those are migrations, code smells, security needs, cross-collaboration, or other information about code. 
   1. We want to focus this project on the most pressing needs of our customers, before expanding it to cover continually more use cases. 

### Short term

Our goals for the current iteration can be found in our [iteration goals living Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n9WKjieKmd2YYkNrEsOfdmxRYUrbowLWjq05phLoQ6s/edit).

The individual tasks and progress of the current iteration can be found as GitHub issues in our [GitHub project board](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/45?fullscreen=true).

## Roadmap

1. âœ… Existing sourcegraph extensions are more discoverable ([RFC 209](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I5BMEGp3QuB81AjSzLCQwq_XJV1sXevlU0lpB4O1pj8/edit#))
1. âœ… The Sourcegraph browser extension is more discoverable and easy to congifure ([RFC 221](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19f4xleYBU1zZZdqMmXlLmFxeR-fwEpOwTOgViOFOnyo/edit))
1. âœ… Build new and improved Sourcegraph extensions to showcase the value and opportunity of extensions ([RFC 246](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HngEeLNAe7_QzVJr6UPi0Si4ZALqTzb7uonOxUiJP6g/edit))
1. âœ… Improve the Sourcegraph extensions (internal) development experience ([RFC 155](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ikrUNVe3YVbR-JpegxhjrFdmRkTGzTLcOMkKHnOyjuE/edit)) and (external) documentation
1. ðŸ”„ Code insights TBD
1. Sourcegraph web app navigation is clearer and intentionally designed ([RFC 248](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AEeCuXuYGlu2kU9HfTuh5rMuoL2ASxy-G4LFje_ySFE/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=110069214620879702746))
1. Page title breadcrumbs are unified and useful 
1. Later-stage code insights work
