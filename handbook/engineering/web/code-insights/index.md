## What is code insights?

Code insights is the first feature in Sourcegraph that can tell you things about your code at a **high level**.

Code insights dashboards will answer questions like "How is a migration progressing?", "What areas of the code are most vulnerable to bugs?", and "How many developers are using a specific API?" Code insights will also incorporate third-party data like code coverage or static analysis metrics to deliver on the promise of aggregating everything you can know about your code.

Sourcegraph is in the unique position to give these insights because we have universal code search: to know _anything_ about your code at a high level confidently means you must know _everything_ about your code at a low level.

Code insights connects many features that Sourcegraph already has and builds on top of them.
We go beyond single-step code intelligence and search to connect the full cycle of analyzing (code intelligence), monitoring (code insights), and actionably changing a codebase (batch changes).

Code insights is the first feature primarily built for non-search-based user personas (developers), instead focusing first on the needs of engineering directors and VPs.

For more information about code insights, see the original [product document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EHzor6I1GhVVIpl70mH-c10b1tNEl_p1xRMJ9qHQfoc/edit) or this [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqeRb6Mc4Co) of a code insights prototype. Anyone on the Sourcegraph team can create your own insight using the [quickstart guide](https://gist.github.com/Joelkw/f0582b164578aabc3ac936dee43f23e0), which is explicitly not in the Sourcegraph docs because code insights is undergoing rapid development and this setup will soon change.

## Goals and roadmap

[Goals and roadmap](goals.md)

The code insights team also keeps a [backlog GitHub project board](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/118). We use the backlog for tracking bugs, small features, and unplanned work. We don't use the backlog for tracking work that is expressly planned in our [roadmap](goals.md#roadmap).
