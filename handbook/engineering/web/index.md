# Web team

[Roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cBsE9801DcBF9chZyMnxRdolqM_1c2pPyGQz15QAvYI/edit#heading=h.g2wq4qci7wj0)

## Vision

**Code host integrations** are a breeze to set up, and add compelling value when reading or reviewing code. Enabling native code host integrations for all users is a no-brainer for site admins.

**Sourcegraph extensions** empower users to integrate Sourcegraph with any third-party service providing useful information about code (code coverage, exception tracking, tracing, code quality). They are consistently supported across all code host integrations and the Sourcegraph UI.

Through extensions, Sourcegraph surfaces high-level [**code insights**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EHzor6I1GhVVIpl70mH-c10b1tNEl_p1xRMJ9qHQfoc/edit) to engineering leaders, empowering data-driven decisions.

The **Sourcegraph UI** is clean, cohesive, stable and responsive.

## Contact

- #web channel or @web-team in Slack.

## Tech stack

TypeScript, React, RxJS, GraphQL, Go.

## Processes

We do [weekly check-ins](../tracking_issues.md#using-a-tracking-issue-for-progress-check-ins) (between Friday EOD and Monday 5am PT) and [planning](../tracking_issues.md#planning-a-milestone-with-a-tracking-issue) with [tracking issues](../tracking_issues.md).

## Team syncs

The web team holds weekly syncs.

The meeting notes of web team syncs can be found [in this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1IUsjbtYdGiAHvRUB1yf4eqnynin9WsxFR2zFCMm78jw/edit#).

Before web team syncs, teammates and stakeholders should write down under "Discussion items" in the meeting notes document anything that they'd like to bring up for discussion with the whole team.
