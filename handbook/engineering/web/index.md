# Web team

[Roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cBsE9801DcBF9chZyMnxRdolqM_1c2pPyGQz15QAvYI/edit#heading=h.g2wq4qci7wj0)

## Vision statement

Bring the power of Sourcegraph (e.g. search, code intelligence, campaigns) to all developers everywhere that they interact with code (e.g. command line, editors, web browser, code hosts).

## Contact

- #web channel or @web-team in Slack.
- [team/web](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/new?labels=team/web) label and [@sourcegraph/web](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/teams/web) team on GitHub.

## Tech stack

TypeScript, React, RxJS, GraphQL, Go.

### Weekly check-ins

Everyone writes a weekly check-in in the active tracking issue of the on-going iteration. These check-ins describe the work done in the previous week as well as what's to come in the next week.

This process helps each teammate reflect and plan each week proactively and enables other parts of the organization to have visibility into on-going progress.

Appropriate times to write this check-in are end of day on Friday or beginning of day on Monday.

## Team syncs

The web team holds weekly syncs.

The meeting notes of web team syncs can be found [in this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1IUsjbtYdGiAHvRUB1yf4eqnynin9WsxFR2zFCMm78jw/edit#).

Before web team syncs, teammates and stakeholders should write down under "Discussion items" in the meeting notes document anything that they'd like to bring up for discussion with the whole team.
