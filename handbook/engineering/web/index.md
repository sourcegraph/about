# Web team

[Roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cBsE9801DcBF9chZyMnxRdolqM_1c2pPyGQz15QAvYI/edit#heading=h.g2wq4qci7wj0)

## Vision

**Code host integrations** are a breeze to set up, and add compelling value when reading or reviewing code. Enabling native code host integrations for all users is a no-brainer for site admins.

**Sourcegraph extensions** empower users to integrate Sourcegraph with any third-party service providing useful information about code (code coverage, exception tracking, tracing, code quality). They are consistently supported across all code host integrations and the Sourcegraph UI.

Through extensions, Sourcegraph surfaces high-level [**code insights**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EHzor6I1GhVVIpl70mH-c10b1tNEl_p1xRMJ9qHQfoc/edit) to engineering leaders, empowering data-driven decisions.

The **Sourcegraph UI** is clean, cohesive, stable and responsive.

## Contact

- #web channel or @web-team in Slack.
- [team/web](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/new?labels=team/web) label and [@sourcegraph/web](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/teams/web) team on GitHub.

## Tech stack

TypeScript, React, RxJS, GraphQL, Go.

## Team syncs

The web team holds weekly syncs.

The meeting notes of web team syncs can be found [in this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1IUsjbtYdGiAHvRUB1yf4eqnynin9WsxFR2zFCMm78jw/edit#).

## Team sync preparation

Before web team syncs:

- Teammates should write down in the meeting notes document a brief status update stating what they have achieved since the last sync, and what they plan on working on next. Example:
  ```
  Lo√Øc:
  - Last:
      - Reduced UI for GitLab integration
      - Bugs: hover overlay position, exceptions on MRs
  - Next:
      - https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/6520
  ```
- Teammates and stakeholders (such as the product manager or the VP of Engineering) should write down under "Discussion items" in the meeting notes document anything that they'd like to bring up for discussion with the whole team.
