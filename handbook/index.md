# Sourcegraph handbook

The Sourcegraph handbook describes how we (Sourcegraph teammates) work. It's publicly visible because we are an [open company](../company/index.md#open-company).

The handbook is a living document and we expect every teammate to propose improvements, changes, additions, and fixes to keep it continuously up-to-date and accurate. [How to edit the handbook](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/editing).
