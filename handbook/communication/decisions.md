# Making decisions

When making decisions at Sourcegraph, it's important to:

1. Know which pending decisions need to be made soon.
1. Gather input for decisions from people with relevant knowledge.
1. Decide quickly and precisely.
1. Communicate the decision and the rationale clearly.
1. Review the decision with the benefit of hindsight to understand what we got right or wrong.
1. Ensure clear owners are responsible for following through on the decision with the appropriate context on prioritization and timing.

These things become more important as we grow, so we're trying to be more deliberate about decision-making.

## Decisions sheet

> This is optional and experimental. We'll be iterating on this. Try it and post your feedback in #handbook on Slack!

[**Decisions (Google Sheet)**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CVdqgSYyukW_eMlfKUDSRZpT9xzYHRDMH5NYbZRVLzQ/edit)

1. This sheet is for decisions that are:
   - high risk (difficult or costly to unwind, or with big/unknown long-term implications); and
   - not able to be reached by consensus within 5 minutes.
1. When a decision needs to be made, add a row.
   - Even if the decision hasn't been made yet (but needs to be made soon), it's still useful to add a row with as many cells filled out as possible.
   - For information on each column, see the column header notes. We will document these in the handbook once we find a set of descriptions that work well.
1. The recommender is responsible for adding a `Revisit decision: ...` item to the relevant weekly meeting agenda for the decision when its revisit date is reached.
