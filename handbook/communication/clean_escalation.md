# Clean escalation

Clean escalation is a process that can be used when there is a disagreement on the team about how to best pursue the organizational mission.

The mechanics are simple.

1. Two people have a conflict.
1. They attempt to [resolve the conflict](conflict_resolution.md) directly with each other.
1. If they can't resolve the conflict, then they come to a [shared understanding](conflict_resolution.md#building-a-shared-understanding) of the situation and agree to cleanly escalate the conflict to their manager(s) *together*.
1. The manager(s) verify that the pre-conditions for a clean escalation (i.e., the previous two steps) have been met.
    - If so, the manager(s) can engage in a conversation to help resolve the conflict.
    - If not, the manager(s) do not get involved in the conflict, and instead ask the involved parties to follow this documented clean escalation process.
1. If the manager(s) are not able to resolve the conflict, they can cleanly escalate to the next level of management. This process continues until the issue is resolved.

The clean escalation process is based on LinkedIn's clean escalation policy that Fred Kofman wrote about in [How to Escalate Disagreements Cleanly â€“ A Coaching Conversation](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-escalate-disagreements-cleanly-coaching-77-fred-kofman/). The inline video walks through an edge case to give a better insight into how this process works in practice. It is worth watching before you initiate your first clean escalation.
