# Company meeting

1. Schedule: every Monday 10:30-11:00am PST/PDT (link in the calendar event)
   - If Monday is a holiday, the meeting is held on the next non-holiday day.
   - There is no company meeting held between December 25 and December 31. The first company meeting of the year is held on the first non-holiday Monday of the year.
1. The link to the slides is posted in #general each Thursday before.
1. We used to call this "team meeting", but now we call it "company meeting" because "team meeting" sounds like it's only for one specific team inside the company.
