# Team chat

We use Slack for team chat.

## Retention

Slack is not a [source of truth](index.md#sources-of-truth) which means it should only be used for ephemeral conversations. To enforce this, only 90 days of Slack activity in public channels is retained. Any important decisions or changes need to be reflected in the [source of truth](index.md#sources-of-truth).

Exceptions:

- #distributioneers retains messages indefinitely because a lot of customer context ends up in Slack threads and it is not currently practical to move that to another system of record.
- #customer-updates similarly retains messages for two years because a lot of customer context ends up in Slack threads and it is not currently practical to move that to another system of record.
- #feedback retains messages indefinitely because it provides a good source of user testimonials.
- #engaging-external-engineers retains indefinitely because team chat is the easiest way to solicit advice from our broader team, and the questions are usually one-off, so it wouldn't make sense to try to make this more organized.
- All channels that we share with customers or prospects (typically containing the prefixes #trial- or #support-) retain messages indefinitely to preserve context for support or audit-related purposes.

If you consult this, please be sure to add whatever information you learn to a source of truth so we reduce our reliance on this archive.

## Avoid private messages

1. When using Slack for work-related purposes, avoid private messages. [Private messages discourage collaboration](https://blog.flowdock.com/2014/04/30/beware-of-private-conversations/). You might actually be contacting the wrong person, and they cannot easily redirect you to the right person. If the person is unavailable at the moment, it is less efficient because other people can't jump in and help. Use a public channel and mention the person or group you want to reach. This ensures it is easy for other people to chime in, involve other people if needed, and learn from whatever is discussed.
1. If someone sends you a work-related private message, it is OK to let them know you'd like to take the conversation to a public channel, linking to this section of the handbook. The process might look something like:

- In the private message: <code>Thanks for reaching out. That's a great question/idea that I think the rest of the team could benefit from. I'm going to move this to #public-channel based on [our desire to avoid private messages](#avoid-private-messages).</code>
- In the appropriate public channel: `@person asked "question" in a DM, pulling that out here if anyone else has input.`
- Answer the question in a thread on that channel message, allowing others to benefit.

1. If you must send a work-related private message, [don't start a conversation with "Hi" or "Hey"](http://www.nohello.com/) because that interrupts their work without communicating anything. If you have a quick question, just ask the question directly, and the person will respond asynchronously. If you truly need to have a synchronous communication, then start by asking for that explicitly, while mentioning the subject. For example: "I'm having trouble understanding issue XYZ. Can we talk about it quickly?".

If you are a new member of the engineering team, you'll most likely want to join all of the channels in the engineering section below.

## Send (and read) messages any time

Because Sourcegraph is a global, [all-remote company](../../company/remote/index.md) with [flexible work hours](../../company/remote/index.md#is-there-an-expectation-to-work-over-the-weekends), teammates should feel free to send messages to others at any time, rather than trying to guess what a convenient time would be for the other party (or parties) involved.

However, a corollary to this is that they are free to read your message whenever is convenient for them. There is no expectation that people will be responsive over the [weekend/vacation/evening/etc.](../../company/remote/index.md#is-there-an-expectation-to-work-over-the-weekends).

Make sure to set up Slack to only send you notifications when you want to see them!

### Engineering

All engineers should join the following channels (feel free to adjust your notification preferences for each as you see fit, though):

- #dev-announce - Things that affect a majority of the dev team in some way (e.g. site or buildkite is down, we will have expected downtime, etc.). *You should read every message in here, and messages you post to it should have a high signal-noise ratio.*
- #dev-chat - Anything related to Sourcegraph development :).
- #dev-ops - Discussing incidents and any other ops-related work.
- #buildkite - Notifications about Buildkite / CI failures.
- #opsgenie - Pager notifications get sent to Slack.

You should also join channels mentioned in [your team's documentation](../engineering/index.md#teams)
