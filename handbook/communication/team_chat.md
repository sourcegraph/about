We use [Slack for team chat](index.md#slack). We have many Slack channels. You don't have to join them all, but here is a good breakdown of the most active ones by category.

### Engineering general

All engineers should join the following channels (feel free to adjust your notification preferences for each as you see fit, though):

- #dev-announce - Things that affect a majority of the dev team in some way (e.g. site or buildkite is down, we will have expected downtime, etc.). *You should read every message in here, and messages you post to it should have a high signal-noise ratio.*
- #dev-chat - anything related to Sourcegraph development :)
- #dev-ops - discussing incidents and any other ops-related work
- #buildkite - see notifications about Buildkite / CI failures.
- #opsgenie - where pager notifications get sent to Slack
