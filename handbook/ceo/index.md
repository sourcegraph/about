# CEO

I (Quinn Slack) am the CEO of Sourcegraph. This page describes my responsibilities and how to get what you need from me. It's intended to be helpful to our team and as a linkable reference to answer common questions (I don't expect everyone to [memorize](../usage.md#links) this page).

## Responsibilities

See "[Roles of the CEO](roles.md)".

## Communicating with me

The best way to communicate is [asynchronously and publicly](../communication.md). If you need a video call with me, [send me a calendar invite](../communication.md#scheduling-meetings) and include an agenda in the description.

My preferred working hours are 10:30-17:00 PT and 20:00-03:00 PT (Google Calendar does not let me specify a noncontigous "working hours" block).

I've found recurring meetings with specific single teammates (other than my [1-1s](../leadership/1-1.md)) to be ineffective. In most cases, people either want to discuss topics with me that are best discussed with a larger group or someone else, or they don't have any topics to discuss but don't want to offend me by canceling the recurring event.

### Asking for a review from me

If you need me to review something (such as a blog post or plan), please state:

- The context (ideally a single link to an RFC or other written down doc)
- What input you need from me

This is to avoid me jumping in and making low-level wording fixes when you're looking for high-level strategy input.

If the document to be reviewed isn't private, please post the review request with the context above [publicly](../communication.md). Other people involved may have relevant context of their own to share.
