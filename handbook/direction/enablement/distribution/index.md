# Distribution team goals

Goals are continuously updated and reviewed. If you find these goals do not reflect our current priorities or are out of date, please update them as soon as possible or add it as a topic to our [weekly sync](../../../engineering/distribution/recurring_processes.md#weekly-distribution-team-sync).

## Goals

Progress toward our goals is described in our [roadmap](#roadmap) and the linked Productboards.

### Understand Sourcegraph site-admin requirements

**[Productboard](https://sourcegraph.productboard.com/feature-board/2612407-fy2022-roadmap-distribution/features/7253378/detail/expanded)**

Sourcegraph collects a number of data points through pings that are used to understand how customers use Sourcegraph and drive how we improve the product. We currently do not have any metrics, pings or manual data points collected from site-admins, which makes it impossible for the Distribution team to make educated guesses on features that site-admins require and how projects should be prioritized.

### Fast and reliable deployments to Sourcegraph Cloud

**[Productboard](https://sourcegraph.productboard.com/feature-board/2612407-fy2022-roadmap-distribution/features/7274917/detail/expanded)**

Our existing deployment pipelines to our Sourcegraph instances (such as Sourcegraph Cloud) has several usability problems - for example, it is hard for engineers to identify when a commit on `sourcegraph/sourcegraph` was deployed to an environment or which deployment is currently running in a particular environment. We want to improve the deployment experience, making sure we can deploy with confidence and can easily understand in which stage of the pipeline a change currently is.
