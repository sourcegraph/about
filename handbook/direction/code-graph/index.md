# Code Graph

The Code Graph org builds and scales the Code Graph and how our users interact with it. We are responsible for search (the user experience as well as performance), insights, code intelligence, and batch changes. This page describes overarching initiatives that tie multiple teams and milestones within Code Graph together.

This page describes the mission and strategy that ties these teams together, but individual team direction pages will tell you more about what each team is doing next; these can be found on our [direction home page](../index.md#code-graph).

## Mission

We want to build a product that makes working with code better, independent of the size and rate of growth of the codebase. Our goal is to enable everyone in every codebase to understand & change the code they're working with, no matter how big or complex, and to enable more people to contribute. We provide the main features that people use every day when using Sourcegraph, both at the free and paid tiers of the product, and so it is part of our mission to maintain the progression of users from free to paid by having a clear flow with value at each tier, and ultimately delivering a product that people love and want to buy.

When it comes down to it, our job is to deliver a compelling, complete solution for enterprises in environments with a lot of code, a variety of languages, tools, and processes, and fast delivery cycles, so we can help them increase quality, get more people contributing, and deliver value faster.

## Vision

### One Year vision

> Our vision over the next year is to ensure that we are solving the most important problems for our enterprise users, with a focus on retention and new customer acquisition. By ensuring we're providing as much value as possible to our paying customers, we can grow the business while also solving some of the hardest scaling and complexity problems that are relevant to everyone - even our free users.

### Three Year vision

> Within three years we imagine a much more connected Code Graph experience, not just in terms of the kinds of searching that you're able to do, but in how we are able to offer suggestions for interesting searches and what you can do with the results, automatically. Expanding on our capabilities we've introduced recently, such as semantic search, insights, and batch changes, we will be able to offer an unparalleled solution for not just searching but making decisions across branches, repositories, and even code hosts, at a level beyond even what's possible today.

### Ten year vision

> At the ten year mark we have a vision where the using Sourcegraph to understand and modify code is at the level where everyone can do it. We want to [democratize coding](../../company/strategy.md##10-year-vision) by making it so that everyone in the company can engage with the organization's code, making changes that to code directly coming from their department's priorities and interests.

## Focus Areas

Within the Code Graph there are several themes that we are focused on right now, which will help us make our one year vision reality. They are not listed in priority order as we are going after all of them. To see how these play into what any particular product area is delivering, take a look the individual team direction pages, as indexed on our [direction home page](../index.md#code-graph)

### Make the power and value of the Code Graph more readily apparent and easy to use

Learning what's possible and how to get the most out of Code Graph tends to be trial and error, especially for an individual developer who might have a unique set of use cases and interests that they would benefit from searching for. Making onboarding and interaction easier helps our users and sales teams demonstrate the value of our product more quickly than is possible today. We're introducing features that make the value of different product areas more discoverable, and which can serve as a jumping off point for easily finding and using more advanced features.

### Level up our enterprise-ready features

How our product works in terms of pricing, upgrade paths, auditing, single sign on, access control, and so on are important for enterprise customers with large, complex organizations. In partnership with our Cloud team, we're focused on ensuring that these elements of our product meet and exceed these needs, so that when it comes to rolling out Sourcegraph the logistics of getting set up don't get in the way of realizing the value of Big Code search.

### Deliver a unified Code Graph experience

Code Graph solves real problems today, but investing in the polish, user experience, and cross-feature functionality within our product area to really make the experience lovable, and will help us deliver solutions that are more than the sum of the parts. Code insights can lead you to a more detailed search, from which you might launch a more advanced semantic analysis. From here you might use batch changes to remediate a problem, and then document everything you've done in a search notebook. This flow works today, but we can do more to make these experiences connected to each other in ways that deliver more value than engaging with them separately.

### Scale the Code Graph for Big Code

We have more and more very large customers, who are dealing with a lot of code and complexity at scale. It's critically important that our platform meets the needs of these kinds of customers, not just in terms of search performance, but in providing solutions that allow you to explore and understand complex interrelationships of source code, at the [worlds largest scale](../../press-release/big-code-survey-2020/index.md). For this reason we're investing a lot in the underlying technologies that power Sourcegraph, in order to ensure they are ready for whatever our customers throw at them.
