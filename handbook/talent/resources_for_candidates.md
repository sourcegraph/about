## Candidate experience 

We know that interviewing can be stressful and that a lot of time and energy is spent as you go through the process. We are committed to providing a world-class candidate experience, so if there's anything we can do to make your experience more enjoyable, please feel free to email recruiting@sourcegraph.com.  You can also provide anonymous feedback in the candidate survey sent via Greenhouse after you are 1) declined or 2) sign your offer. 

Specifically, we aim to provide a positive candidate experience by...

- Treating all candidates with respect at all stages, regardless of hiring outcome.
- Writing our job descriptions as clearly as possible to ensure you have a good understanding of the job and the impact you would make in the role. All job descriptions are written in an [inclusive format](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/hiring/interview_process#creating-a-job-description), encouraging candidates from all walks of life to apply. 
- Ensuring that our interview process is structured, that all interview questions [are planned](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/hiring/interview_process#creating-an-interview-plan) in advance of all interviews.
- [Recording our interviews](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/hiring/guide_to_using_brighthire) to ensure we are focused on what you is saying, and not on taking notes.  
- Providing candidates with the tools to be successful in an interview, including transparancy around our [interview process](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/the_interview_process), information about what to expect at a given [stage of the interview](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/types_of_interviews), and resources on [how to prepare](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/how_to_prepare_for_candidates) for the interview.
- Offering clear, honest and consistent communication throughout all stages of the interview process.  We try our best to get back to you quickly and will never waste your time if we know we're not moving you forward in our process.
- Maintaining a respectful process for rejecting job applicants who do not more forward in the interview process or recieve an offer.
- Smoothly transitioning new hires into the onboarding process.

## Respecting time

Interviewing requires time and effort, both for Sourcegraph teammates and for our candidates. The hiring manager is responsible for monitoring feedback during the interview phase, and if it becomes obvious that we won't be moving forward with a candidate, then the hiring manager should cancel any remaining interviews to be respectful of both the candidate's and interviewers' time.

## Company financials

Choosing to join a company is a significant commitment. We want people to have an accurate view of Sourcegraph's financial and business position before they join. (Every Sourcegraph team member after they join has regular access to this information on our Google Drive, and they can ask the CEO directly if they have any other questions).  To learn more about our company financials, click [here](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/hiring#sharing-company-financials).

## Policy for candidates re-applying to roles

# Candidate FAQ

- Q: Can I work from anywhere?
   - A: Yes, Sourcegraph is an all-remote company. Unless indicated explicitly in the job description, we are a remote-first company and do not have a preference regarding your location.  You can read more about our all-remote philosophy, as well as our path to all remote and tips for working remotely [here](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/company/remote). 

- Q: When can I expect to hear feedback?
   - A: We aim to respond to all applications within 5 business days of your application date.  If you are a candidate in our interview process, you can expect to hear from us within 3 business days. If you would like a status update on your candidacy, please contact your recruiter or email recruiting@sourcegraph.com.

- Q: Why does Sourcegraph record interviews?
   - A: We use [BrightHire](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/hiring/guide_to_using_brighthire#what-is-brighthire), an interview recording tool, to record all interviews.  We do this because we believe that candidates should be assessed based on merit, not our memory (did you know that one hour after an interview, memory recall of the conversation declines to 44%?). BrightHire allows us to revisit key details, revise initial impressions, and replace implicit bias with explicit evidence. It brings structure and consistency to each interview and ensures that every candidate gets the opportunity they deserve.  Have questions?

- Q: Does Sourcegraph check references?
   - A: References can be requested by the hiring manager on a case-by-case basis. If we choose to conduct a reference check, we will send you a reference request form via Greenhouse, and we will never check your references without your explicit consent.  You can read more about our reference check process [here](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/hiring/reference_check_questions).

- Q: Does Sourcegraph provide feedback to candidates who don't recieve an offer?
   - A: We do not provide feedback to candidates at this time.  We encourage you to read more about our [philosophy regarding sharing candidate feedback](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/hiring#sharing-interview-feedback).
