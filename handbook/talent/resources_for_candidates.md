## Sharing interview feedback

You can read about our philosophy regarding sharing candidate feedback after an interview [here](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/hiring#sharing-interview-feedback).

## Respecting time

Interviewing requires time and effort, both for Sourcegraph teammates and for our candidates. The hiring manager is responsible for monitoring feedback during the interview phase, and if it becomes obvious that we won't be moving forward with a candidate, then the hiring manager should cancel any remaining interviews to be respectful of both the candidate's and interviewers' time.

Choosing to join a company is a significant commitment. We want people to have an accurate view of Sourcegraph's financial and business position before they join. (Every Sourcegraph team member after they join has regular access to this information on our Google Drive, and they can ask the CEO directly if they have any other questions).

Q: Why does Sourcegraph record interviews?
- A: We use BrightHire, an interview recording tool, to record all interviews.  We do this because we believe that candidates should be assessed based on merit, not our memory (did you know that one hour after an interview, memory recall of the conversation declines to 44%?). BrightHire allows us to revisit key details, revise initial impressions, and replace implicit bias with explicit evidence. It brings structure and consistency to each interview and ensures that every candidate gets the opportunity they deserve.  Read more about BrightHire [here](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/hiring/guide_to_using_brighthire#what-is-brighthire), and access our FAQ [here](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/hiring/guide_to_using_brighthire#candidate-faq).
