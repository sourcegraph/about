# How to partner with the recruiting team

### Background
Each hiring managers has an assigned recruiter for their hiring needs:  

Talent team: 
    - [Devon Coords](../company/team/index.md#devon-coords-she-her), Senior Technical Recruiter, Team Lead, is responsible for all technical and product hiring
    - [Kelsey Nagel], G&A Recruiter, is responsible for all Marketing, Finance, Legal, Operations, and People team hiring
    - [Trevor Houghton](../company/team/index.md#trevor-houghton-he-him), Recruitment Operations Specialist, is responsible for scheduling all interviews. If you need to schedule a candidate for an interview, please reach out to Trevor. 
    - We are hiring additional Recruiters and more support is coming soon!

### Objective
To describe and understand ownership of responsibilities throughout the hiring process. 

### Estimated timeline to first hire:
Our time-to-fill goal is an average of 45-days.  This means that the timespan from intake meeting to candidate offer acceptance (when a candidate signs their offer letter) should be, on average, 45-days or less.  

### Recruiting lifecycle 
Opening a new job:
- To open a new role, the Hiring Manager fills out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ju9waV4k_TpYMGmYZaH5eA2swkuvIthLFKQCzqrRUZM/edit), creates a job description using [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rJAYyARbegvvH_e-VTrHoFhU9cDG5WfHov3L12NeCO8/edit), and creates an [interview plan]https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pMG_K3pf_pP_AIvy8jjOKc-h6htDJ5QkvEMD3prAQ5Y/edit#gid=1566158302
- Recruiter opens the job in Greenhouse and builds out the interview plan, adding all structured questions directly into each interview stage
- Recruiter posts the job to our [Careers page](https://boards.greenhouse.io/sourcegraph91) and LinkedIn. If you would like it posted in other locations, please ask your Recruiter or send a Slack message to @hiring.
Recruiting Stage:
- Recruiter reviews applicants & sources passive candidates
- Recruiter screens eligible candidates
- Recruiter submits qualified candidates to Hiring Manager 
- Recruiting schedules onsite interview for candidates
Offer stage:
- Once finalist is identified, Recruiter completes references
- Recruiter confirms level and compensation, you can see our compensation philosophy [here](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/people-ops/compensation#components-of-compensation)
- Recruiter submits offer for approval in Greenhouse
   - Approval chain: VP Talent > Hiring Manager > Department Head > VP Operations
- Once fully approved in Greenhouse, Recruiter scheduled offer summary call 
   - The purpose of the offer summary call is to review our offer, 1) including compensation 2) perks, travel, and benefits (if applicable) and 3) equity
   - Attendees: Recruiter, Hiring Manager, Candidate
- Following the offer call, Recruiter sends the offer summary to the candidate in an email 
- Once the candidate verbally accepts, the VP Talent send the official offer to the candidate via Docusign 
After the offer:
- After the candidate signs the offer, the Recruiting team sends a welcome email to the candidate and Cc's the hiring manager
- The Recruiting team marks the candidate as "Hired" in Greenhouse, closes the job, and exports the candidate to Bamboo
- The People Operations team then works with the candidate to onboard them and get them set up for their first day
