# How to partner with the recruiting team

## The Talent team
Each hiring manager has an assigned recruiter for their hiring needs. If you are unsure which Recruiter you should partner with, please Slack @hiring to inquire.

## Estimated timeline to first hire:
Our time-to-fill goal is an average of 45-days.  This means that the timespan from intake meeting to candidate offer acceptance (when a candidate signs their offer letter) should be, on average, 45-days or less.  Please keep in mind that we should kick off a role at least 2-3 months prior to our target start date.  
    - (45 day time-to-fill) + (2-4 week notice period) + (1-2 week break in between jobs) = 3 months from the time we kick off the job to when our new teammate starts 

## Recruiting lifecycle

### Opening a new job
- To open a new role, the below steps need to be completed by the Hiring Manager:
    - The Hiring Manager fills out [this intake form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ju9waV4k_TpYMGmYZaH5eA2swkuvIthLFKQCzqrRUZM/edit).
    - The Hiring Manager then creates a job description using [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rJAYyARbegvvH_e-VTrHoFhU9cDG5WfHov3L12NeCO8/edit).
    - The Hiring Manager creates an [interview plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pMG_K3pf_pP_AIvy8jjOKc-h6htDJ5QkvEMD3prAQ5Y/edit#gid=1566158302).
- Once the Hiring Manager completes the 1) intake form 2) the job description and 3) the interview plan, the Recruiter takes the below actions:
    - Recruiter schedules an intake meeting with the Hiring Manager to kick off the search.
    - Recruiter opens the job in Greenhouse and builds out the interview plan, adding all behavioral-based, structured questions directly into each interview stage.
    - Recruiter posts the job to our [Careers page](https://boards.greenhouse.io/sourcegraph91) and LinkedIn. If you would like it posted in other locations, please ask your Recruiter or send a Slack message to @hiring.

### Recruiting Stage
- Recruiter reviews applicants.
    - To advance a candidate to the Recruiter screen stage, Recruiter uses the Calendly template in Greenhouse to schedule.
    - To reject a candidate, Recruiter sends rejection email template.
- Recruiter sources passive candidates.
    - [Resources to target passive candidates] ... Coming soon.
    - [Boolean search best practices] ... Coming soon.
    - [Inmail best practices] ... Coming soon.
- Recruiter conducts a phone screen with eligible candidates.
- Recruiter submits qualified candidates to Hiring Manager.
- Recruiting Coordinator schedules additional interviews for candidates.
    - [Interview process for each department] ... Coming soon.
- The hiring team (including the Recruiter, Hiring Manager, and all other interviewers) debriefs and makes final hiring decision.
    - This can be done in a synchronous fashion via a meeting, or asynchronously via Slack.

### Offer stage
- Once finalist is identified, Recruiter completes references.
- Recruiter confirms level and compensation.
    - View our compensation philosophy [here](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/people-ops/compensation#components-of-compensation)
- Recruiter submits offer for approval in Greenhouse.
   - Approval chain: VP Talent > Hiring Manager > Department Head > VP Operations.
- Once fully approved in Greenhouse, Recruiter schedules offer summary call. The purpose of the offer summary call is to review our offer with the candidate and answer any questions they may have.  
   - Attendees: Recruiter, Hiring Manager, Candidate.
   - During the call, we review: 1) compensation 2) equity 3) perks, travel (and benefits, if applicable). 
   - Before ending the call, be sure to determine a potential start date (all starts dates should fall on a cohort Monday) and 2) schedule a follow up call to answer any questions.
- Following the offer call, Recruiter sends the offer summary to the candidate in an email. 
- Once the candidate verbally accepts, the VP Talent send the official offer to the candidate via Docusign.
- The Hiring Manager posts an announcement of the candidate's acceptance in the Slack #Hiring channel.

### After the offer
- After the candidate signs the offer, the Recruiting team sends a welcome email to the candidate and Cc's the hiring manager.
- The Recruiting team marks the candidate as "Hired" in Greenhouse, closes the job, and exports the candidate to Bamboo.
- The People Operations team then works with the candidate to onboard them and get them set up for their first day.
