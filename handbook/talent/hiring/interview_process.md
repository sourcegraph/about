# The Sourcegraph Interview Process

## Creating a job description 
The way a job description is written can plan a key role in promoting positive Diversity & Inclusion efforts. Countless studies have shown that certain demographics are less likely than others to apply if they don’t meet 100% of the outlined qualifications.  To that end, Sourcegraph's job description format focuses on the impact a candidate will make in the role versus a long list of requirements that have historically impeded underrepresented candidates from applying, resulting in a larger and more diverse candidate pool.  

The goal of the job description is to focus on getting the candidate excited, while giving a clear representation on what we expect them to accomplish.  How will working out Sourcegraph benefit them in their career?  Why is this the best job they’ll ever have?

Best practices for writing a job description 
- Be mindful of the words you use!  [Here is a list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HOLapvWgrD361l2u50nms_q_SZzU__IGxZSj9-1OZbM/edit) of commonly used words that deter underrepresented candidates from applying, as well as inclusive word replacements.  
- Use “you” and “we” statements over indirect phrases like “ideal candidate.”
- Keep descriptions and bullets short.

## Creating an interview plans
Q: Why is building out an interview plan & creating a structured interview process important?  
- A: Creating a structured interview process is critical to our DEI efforts.  Research shows that structured interviews are up to twice as effective at predicting job performance than unstructured ones.  Structuring interviews with a standardized set of questions also allows for a more fair and impartial way of assessing candidates, which helps remove unconscious biases.  

Q: Is creating an interview plan required for all Hiring Managers?
- A: Yes, creating an interview plan is required for all roles.  We recognize that this takes significant planning and effort up front, but it will 1) ensure alignment between the Hiring Manager, the hiring team, and the Recruiter and 2) will ensure consistency.  Creating a strong plan upfront is also proven to reduce time-to-fill, meaning that we will make a hire faster, on average.  

Q: As a Hiring Manager, how do I create an interview plan?
- A: To build your interview plan, please creat a tab in [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pMG_K3pf_pP_AIvy8jjOKc-h6htDJ5QkvEMD3prAQ5Y/edit#gid=1566158302).  The recruiting team will then work with you to build out your plan in Greenhouse. 
- When creating the interview questions, please keep in mind:
  - All interview questions should be written in open ended format (the best way to ensure of this is to start every question with “tell me…”)
  - To ensure all questions are legal, ask yourself “does this question relate to the candidate’s ability to do this job?” … if you can’t confidently say yes, it’s better to not ask it!

Q: How do I choose how to structure the interview process?  
- A: Below is a standard interview process.  You can work with your assigned Recruiter to create an optimal interview plan for your role. All steps in bold are strongly encouraged. 
- 1. **Recruiter screen**
- 2. **Hiring Manager screen**
- 3. Assignment, if applicable 
- 4. Interview stage:
  -  a. **Resume Deep Dive** (aka Topgrade)
  -  b. Assignment review/working session, if applicable
  -  c. Technical interview, if applicable
  -  d. **Peer interview**
  -  e. **Values Interview**

## Types of interviews

**Recruiter screen**
- The purpose of the Recruiter screen is to learn more about your background and interest in Sourcegraph.  The Recruiter will also tell you more about Sourcegraph, the role, compensation/benefits, the interview process, and answer any questions you have.

**Hiring Manager screen**
- During this stage in the interview process, the Hiring Manager introduces themself, gets to know you, and answers any initial questions you may have.  This stage is meant to be conversational and informative for both us and you! 

**Resume deep dive**
- A resume deep dive, often referred to as a "Topgrading Interview," is an interview style where we take a deep dive into your background, past to present.  The goal of a Topgrade interview is to uncover the motivation behind your decision making, as well as your strengths, weaknesses, and accomplishments in your past roles. [Here](https://www.lever.co/blog/topgrading-interview-guide/) is a document to help guide your expectations on the Topgrade interview. This is simply an example of what to expect, and does not represent the questions we will be asking.

**Peer interview**
- During the peer interview, your potential future colleagues will assess if you will be a value-add to the team, take and give constructive criticism, and be an overall supportive team member. This is also an opportunity for you to ask questions directed to your potential future peers.

**Collaboration interview**
- During this stage of the interview process, you will meet with members of another team with whom you would partner regularly.  The goal of this interview is to understand how you communicate and collaborate with cross-functional partners within Sourcegraph. 

**Values interview**
- This interview will be focused entirely on our values and how your views and experiences align with them. Our core values are key to our success as individuals and as a company. You can read more about them [here](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/company/values).
- Every interviewer should be evaluating candidates on the Sourcegraph values in addition to their specific interview topic. See more at [evaluating values](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/hiring/evaluating_values).

## Scheduling

We are flexible when it comes to scheduling interviews because we are all-remote and we don't need to schedule all interviews back-to-back (unlike typical onsite interviews at other companies). Some candidates like spreading interviews out (e.g., across multiple days and/or having breaks between interviews on the same day) and others prefer to batch them as much as possible to get it over with. *Ask the candidate what their ideal interview schedule looks like and then try to accommodate those preferences as much as possible (given interviewer availability)*.

Even if candidates prefer to batch all their interviews together, it might not be possible due to the timezones of available interviewers.

If interviews are spread over multiple days and it is clear from the initial feedback that we won't be moving forward, we will cancel the remaining scheduled interviews to save our teammates and the candidate's time.

To schedule and interview with a candidate, please reach work with your recruiter or Slack @hiring.  You can see a list of Recruiters [here](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/hiring/how_recruiting_interfaces_with_hiring_managers#the-talent-team).

## Providing interview feedback

Please put your written feedback into Greenhouse as soon as possible following the interview (immediately is ideal) while it is still fresh in your mind.  You can also leverage your [BrightHire recording](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/hiring/guide_to_using_brighthire) to revisit key points during the interview when providing feedback.

### Feedback rating

- **Strong positive**. You are confident that this person would make our team better and you would be excited to have the chance to work with them.
- **Positive**. You observed only positive signs that this person would be a good fit for our team, but you don't feel strongly about hiring them.
- **Negative**. You are neutral or have doubts about whether this person would make our team better.
- **Strong negative**. You are very confident that we should not hire this person because they would not be successful on our team.

All positive feedback with no strongly positive feedback is usually not sufficient. We want to hire people who we are excited to work with.

## Interview debriefs

We conduct debriefs after a candidate finishes interviews. The debrief can either take place via a private Slack channel or via a Zoom debrief meeting.  Should the hiring manager decide to not need a debrief (e.g. the feedback was overwhelmingly positive or negative), the hiring manager should post to the candidate’s Greenhouse profile stating the reason and/or context for the decision.
