# Types of interviews 

The below information is intended to help our candidates prepare for each step of the interview. Please note that the example questions are **examples only** and may not be the exact questions asked in the actual interview process. 

## The interview process 

Our hiring managers work with their [assigned recruiter](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent#talent-team-members) to create an optimal interview plan for their role. Below is an example. All steps in bold are strongly encouraged.
 
All role-specific interview processes are documented at the end of each [job description](https://boards.greenhouse.io/sourcegraph91). 
We strive for consistency across all interviews. 
 
- **Recruiter screen**
- **Hiring manager screen**
- Assignment, if applicable
- In-depth Interview stage:
  -  Resume deep dive
  -  Assignment review/working session, if applicable
  -  Technical interview, if applicable
  -  **Cross-team collaboration interview**
  -  **Peer interview**
  -  **Values interview**
  -  Leadership interview

## Structured interview questions
We ask structured questions for all interviews, meaning that all candidates are asked the same questions in an effort to reduce bias and to even the playing-field. The interview [may be recorded](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/hiring/guide_to_using_brighthire) so that we can focus on the candidate, not taking notes, and ensure that we're delivering a great interview experience. If a candidate prefers not to be recorded during the interview, they can let us know - the structure of the interview and decision-making process will remain the same and the decision not to be recorded will have no weight on their candidacy.

# Universal interviews 

All departments are likely to have some or all of the below universal interview stages:

## Recruiter screen 
- Interviewer: the assigned recruiter for the role.
- Duration: 30-minutes.
- Details: the goal of the recruiter screen is to learn more about your background and interest in Sourcegraph. In addition to learning about you, the Recruiter will also tell you about Sourcegraph, the role, compensation/benefits, the interview process, and answer any questions you have.  
- Example questions: 
  -  Tell me about your work experience, past to present.
  -  Why are you looking for something new?
  -  Why are you interested in Sourcegraph and our open position?
  -  What are you looking for in your next role, and what are you career goals?
  -  Do you have overlap with a specific timezone? (only applicable for roles that have time zone requirements)
  -  Tell us how much exposure, if any, you have had working with teammates across time zones. How did you stay connected and up-to-date with your team?

  -  Are your compensation expectations in line with our compensation range, which is XYZ?  
  -  What questions do you have for us?

## Hiring Manager screen

## Resume deep dive 
- Interviewer(s): the hiring manager or a peer leads the Resume deep dive, and sometimes there is another teammate who shadows the interview.
- Duration: 60-minutes.
- Details: a resume deep dive (often referred to as a "Topgrade Interview") is an interview style where we take a deep dive into a candidate's background, past to present.  The goal of a resume deep dive is to uncover the motivation behind a candidate's decision making, as well as their strengths, weaknesses, and accomplishments in past roles. [Here](https://www.lever.co/blog/topgrading-interview-guide/) is a document to help guide expectations on this stage in the interview process. This is simply an example of what to expect, and does not represent the questions we will be asking.
- Example questions: 
  -  How did you find your job?  Why did you choose to accept it?
  -  Who hired you? What was their name? What did they hire you to do?
  -  Why would your former boss say were your strengths and opportunities for growth?
  -  What did you like most and least about your job?
  -  What would your peers say about you?
  -  What are you most proud of accomplishing while in your job?
  -  Why did you leave?

## Peer interview 
- Interviewer(s): the other members of the team for which you're interviewing.
- Duration: 30-45 minutes.
- Details: during the peer interview, your potential future colleagues will assess if you will be a value-add to the team, take and give constructive criticism, and be an overall supportive team member. This is also an opportunity for you to ask questions directed to your potential future peers.
- Example questions: 
  -  Tell us about the best team you've ever been a part of.
  -  Tell us about a time when you had to put your team's interests above your own. 

## Team collaboration interview

**Product manager**

- Async writing project [(RFC Project)](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/product/roles/interviews/product_manager/pm_rfc_project)
  - Interviewer(s): NA - this is a take home assignment. [Two members from the Product team](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/product) will review your RFC and discuss it with you in the next round of interviews. 
  - Duration: ~1 hour
  - Details: This is a take home writing assignment to see how you communicate and think about product problems. Below is the prompt on the project. [Here's how we will measure the project](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/product/roles/interviews/product_manager/pm_rfc_project): 
    - Please write a Request for comments (RFC) in a Google Doc for a recent problem you identified, solved, and shipped (the project is complete). The RFC should communicate how this problem ties to the product vision for your product/product area.
    - It should have our standard RFC structure from the handbook, or see the RFC template: Background, Problem, Proposed solution, and Definition of success. However, our handbook states that the precise format is not as important as the content itself, so feel free to improve upon this format as necessary.
    - Aim for about one page of writing (don’t go over two pages) with standard styling. This is long enough to give us the signal we want, while at the same time is short enough that you don’t experience “writer’s block” and can write it in one sitting. We expect this to take you ~1 hour.
    - What’s important is that the writing is clear and easy to understand. It should show us that you care about your writing by making conscious decisions of what to leave in or out, paying attention to grammar and spelling, and phrasing things in an understandable way.
    - The challenge is to explain something to a reader that doesn’t have the same context as you have, just like you would in a proposal for a new feature.

- Product interview
  - Interviewer(s): [Product Manager and a Product Designer](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/product) who were not the reviewers of the RFC. 
  - Duration: 1 hour
  - Details: In this interview, you will review your RFC and deep dive on how you work as a product manager. Be prepared to discuss the actual proposal, what happened and what you could have done differently. We will be looking for how you use data to drive decisions and get buy-in from collaborators. How you have created solutions for customers, representing their voice across the organization. We will have about product development prioritization, and how you balance priorities of what our customers want with Engineering resources. 

- Engineering collaboration
  - Interviewer(s): Engineering Manager. 
  - Duration: 30 min 
  - Details: In this interview, you will meet with the Engineering Manager from the team you’re interviewing for, your counterpart in the PM-EM responsibilities. We will be evaluating how you collaborate and work within a team, specifically how you partner with Engineering to drive the product vision of your team. We will focus on your technical background, as you will need to be able to discuss the technical aspects of our product with customers and communicate feedback and technical insight to the team. It is important that you demonstrate enthusiasm and understanding for the product and problem space, identifying and communicating the pain that Sourcegraph solves for developers.


**Product designer**

- Portfolio review
  -  Interviewer(s): [Two Product Designers](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/product). 
  -  Duration: 1 hour

  - The interview is in 2 parts. Below is the prompt: 
   - Part 1: (~15 min) Pick a developer application (e.g., code hosts like GitHub or GitLab, cloud providers like AWS or GCP, monitoring tools like Lightstep or Sentry, etc) and walk us through what works well and what doesn’t. We do not want you to prepare a presentation or script, but should come knowing which application you want to use as an example and be prepared to have a conversation about it.
   - Part 2: (~60 min) We will give you a specific problem to solve for Sourcegraph and would like you to walk us through your design process.
