# Types of interviews 

The below information is intended to help our candidates prepare for each step of the interview. Please note that the example questions are **examples only** and may not be the exact questions asked in the actual interview process. 

## The interview process 
All role-specific interview processes are documented at the end of each [job description](https://boards.greenhouse.io/sourcegraph91).  You can also read more about our interview process [here](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/interview_process).   

## Types of interview questions
We ask structured questions for all interviews, meaning that all candidates are asked the same questions in an effort to reduce bias and to even the playing-field. The interview may be recorded so that we can focus on the candidate, not taking notes, and ensure that we're delivering a great interview experience. If a candidate prefers not to be recorded during the interview, they can let us know - the structure of the interview and decision-making process will remain the same and the decision not to be recorded will have no weight on their candidacy.

### Recruiter screen 
- Interviewer: the assigned recruiter for the role.
- Duration: 30-minutes.
- Purpose: the goal of the recruiter screen is to learn more about your background and interest in Sourcegraph. In addition to learning about you, the Recruiter will also tell you about Sourcegraph, the role, compensation/benefits, the interview process, and answer any questions you have.  
- Example questions: 
  -  Tell me about your work experience, past to present.
  -  Why are you looking for something new?
  -  Why are you interested in Sourcegraph and our open position?
  -  What are you looking for in your next role, and what are you career goals?
  -  Do you have overlap with a specific timezone? (only applicable for roles that have time zone requirements)

  -  Are your compensation expectations in line with our compensation range, which is XYZ?  
  -  What questions do you have for us?

### Hiring Manager screen

### Resume deep dive 
- Interviewer(s): the hiring manager or a peer leads the Resume deep dive, and sometimes there is another teammate who shadows the interview.
- Duration: 60-minutes.
- Purpose: a resume deep dive (often referred to as a "Topgrade Interview") is an interview style where we take a deep dive into a candidate's background, past to present.  The goal of a resume deep dive is to uncover the motivation behind a candidate's decision making, as well as their strengths, weaknesses, and accomplishments in past roles. [Here](https://www.lever.co/blog/topgrading-interview-guide/) is a document to help guide expectations on this stage in the interview process. This is simply an example of what to expect, and does not represent the questions we will be asking.
