### Resources for Hiring Managers 

## Estimated time to first hire

Our time-to-fill goal is an average of 45-days.  This means that the timespan from 1) intake meeting to 2) candidate offer acceptance (when a candidate signs their offer letter) should be, on average, 45-days or less.  Please keep in mind that we should kick off a role at least 2-3 months prior to our target start date.  
    - (45 day time-to-fill) + (2-4 week notice period) + (1-2 week vacation in between jobs) = 3 months from the time we kick off the job to when our new teammate starts.

## Using external recruiting agencies

- Q: Who is allowed to engage with external recruiting agencies?
   - A: Any hiring managers that need additional support to fullfill hiring needs can leverage an external agency. Please contact @hiring or recruiting@sourcegraph.com to make a request.
- Q: Am I allowed to engage with an external agency if I have an assigned internal recruiter?
   - A: This should be reviewed on a case by case basis to see what is the required candidate pipeline to meet the teamâ€™s hiring goals. If internal recruiter(s) are not enough to meet the needs of the team then hiring manager can seek external help.
- Q: How do I engage with a new agency?
   - A: To engage with a new agency, please Slack @hiring with your request, including 1) the agency name/contact information and 2) the roles that you would like the agency to work on. 
   - As a next step, the VP of Talent will send and sign all agency agreemnts. 
   - All agencies sign our [standard agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IU_eWoZxEGQS8RRcjuUPfVD-byWScn5bsZE3e3oFZQ0/edit).
   - Our standard agency fee is 20%.
- Q: How do agencies submit candidates for consideration?
   - A: The talent team will set each agency up with a Greenhouse account. All agencies **must** submit candidates via Greenhouse. Please contact @hiring or recruiting@sourcegraph.com to get an agency added to Greenhouse.
