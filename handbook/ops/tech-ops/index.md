# Tech Operations

The Tech Ops team helps implement, build, integrate, upgrade, and maintain all of our enterprise and internal applications. Tech Ops empowers the rest of the business to reach their goals by owning the systems that they rely on every day.

As we scale our team and our customer list, we need help with all of the applications and internal tools that are straining to keep up. From making it easier to onboard new teammates with single sign-on software, to developing custom GitHub and Slack bots, to configuring and maintaining Salesforce, to identifying gaps in our internal processes and recommending system improvements, the Tech Ops team is an essential part of keeping Sourcegraph running smoothly.
