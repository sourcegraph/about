## How we work

We use [GitHub issues in the Sourcegraph analytics repository](https://github.com/sourcegraph/analytics/issues) to document projects, and the [analytics kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/63) for team-wide prioritization and current projects.

## How to work with us

### Contact
Get in touch with us, or ask for our input or help:
- Post in the #analytics or #business-ops channels, or mention @business-ops in any channel
- Tag [@sourcegraph/bizops](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/teams/bizops) in existing [sourcegraph/sourcegraph GitHub issues](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues)

### Larger projects and deliverables
For larger projects BizOps will ideally be in sync with teams and can either anticipate projects or take in projects synchronously, in which case BizOps team members will create the issue(s). When this is not the case, anybody can create an issue using the following format.

Create a new issue in the [analytics repository](https://github.com/sourcegraph/analytics/issues) and add it to the Business Operations project, so it appears on our [project board](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/63) for triage. The following information will be really helpful in understanding and prioritizing the issue:

- **People:** Who is involved, and what are the expectations of each person? Who will be responsible for driving the project forward? Does each person have the necessary bandwidth to uphold the expecations asked of them?
- **End state:** What is the end state of the project? What decisions will be made? Be as specific as possible (i.e. if the end state is a graph, draw out the graph).
- **The why:** How does it support [Sourcegraph's company and team goals](../../company/goals/index.md)?
- **Timeline:** What's the timeline of the project? When does this need to be delivered, and how will it be followed up upon in the future?

Need clarification? Ask a question in the #analytics or #business-ops channels.
