# Operations team onboarding

Welcome to Sourcegraph! 

While [the operations team](index.md) is made of up multiple distinct teams, the onboarding guide below is a starting point for all of us. The first week, covered in detail below, will be common to all operations teams, while weeks 2–4 will involve projects that vary depending on your role.

**[Onboarding buddy](../people-ops/onboarding/buddy-program.md)**: You will be paired up with an “onboarding buddy” in order to become better acquainted with Sourcegraph team and culture. A buddy will be your go-to person for questions (in addition to your manager and the People Ops team).

## Week 1 - getting started

Your objective is to get to know the team and learn as much about Sourcegraph (the company) as possible. It is your responsibility to be proactive in your onboarding, and it is the team's #1 priority to support you and help set you up for success. Everyone will drop what they're doing to help you. We are so excited to have you on the team and can't wait to get to know you better!

- Complete [general onboarding](../people-ops/onboarding/index.md#general-onboarding-checklist)
- Schedule individual meetings with each person on the [operations team](../../company/team/org_chart.md#operations)
- If your team will be working closely with another part of the company (e.g. Sales Ops with Sales, Product Ops with Product, etc.), schedule individual meetings with each person on that team as well (ask Dan if you're not sure who this is)

### Understand company and team goals

- [Sourcegraph values](../../company/values.md)
- [Sourcegraph master plan](../../company/strategy.md)
- [Sourcegraph direction (1 year plan)](../../direction/index.md)
- [Company goals](../../company/goals/index.md)
- [Operations team handbook](index.md)
- Operations team goals (TODO)

### Complete your team-specific week 1 onboarding

- [Sales Ops week 1 onboarding](./sales-ops/onboarding.md)

If you don't see your team listed above, reach out to your manager to get direction.

## Week 2-3 - initial projects

- You will work with your maager to define a handful of projects that will help you familiarize yourself with the team, our processes, and systems, and get some quick wins in your first weeks.
- If you see something that you think would be a great project for you to tackle as you’re onboarding, bring it up with your manager!
- We are excited to get you meatier projects, and also want to make sure you have adequate ramp-up time :)

## Week 4 - start a larger project

- Let’s talk about your strengths, interests, areas you’re excited about, as well as what will help drive the team and company goals!
