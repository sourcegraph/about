# Internal tools

**The internal tools team does not yet exist.** It is a team we want to create and grow. The internal tools team will help build, integrate, improve, and maintain our internal tools and systems.

## Team

We are hiring for the internal tools team! See all [open positions](../roles/index.md).

## Vision

As we scale our team and our customer list, we need help building, integrating, improving, and maintaining all of the systems and internal tools that are straining to keep up. From making it easier to onboard new teammates with single sign-on software, to developing custom GitHub and Slack bots, to configuring and maintaining Salesforce, to identifying gaps in our internal processes and recommending system improvements, the internal tools team is an essential part of keeping Sourcegraph running smoothly.
