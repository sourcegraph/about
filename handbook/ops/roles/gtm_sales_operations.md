# Sales Strategy & Operations Analyst or Manager

We are looking for the first hire on our go-to-market/sales operations team, and the second on our broader business operations team. You will enable and help our GTM teams sell to and support our customers better and faster. You will own sales forecasting and planning, formulation and management of sales and customer engineering incentive programs, collection and analysis of go-to-market metrics, pipeline and territory assignment, and most importantly, helping define sales and customer engineering strategy.

We are open to both Analyst and Manager-level hires for this first role.

Our team and our sales are growing fast—we’ve proven strong product-market fit, with wall-to-wall usage, Net Promoter Scores above 60, and tens of thousands of paid daily active users at some of the world’s premier development teams (Uber, Yelp, Lyft, SoFi, Quantcast, and many more).

You will help build the organization that enables us to reach every developer in the world faster and more efficiently. 

## Responsibilities

### In the first 30 days you will...

- Go through a week-long training program on our product, our value propositions, our customers, our team, and our processes.
- Go through an additional week-long training program on our customer lifecycle, our sales processes, and our support and success functions.
- Work closely with the rest of our Sales and Customer Engineering teams to understand our current operations.
- Dive deep into our OKRs, our metrics (both revenue/ARR and usage/engagement), and our CRM and marketing suite (HubSpot) to understand how we measure our pipeline and customer engagement.
- Work with the rest of our business operations team to understand our go-to-market data collection, needs and gaps, and current modeling capabilities.
- Take ownership of our sales and customer engineering OKRs and tracking.

### In the first 90 days you will...

- Take ownership of our quarterly revenue forecasting process for new accounts and expansion/upsells.
  - Work with our finance and accounting team to build a complete go-to-market top and bottom-line forecast model.
- Take ownership of our sales and customer engineering incentive program management.
- Take on at least one strategic initiative to optimize our sales and/or customer engineering funnels. E.g., sales process evaluation, customer communications playbook, support processes and SLAs, customer success metrics and alerts, and more.

## Qualifications

- Excitement for software development (no training as an Engineer required, but you should have an understanding of how software development happens and Sourcegraph's value proposition).
- Demonstrated understanding of how B2B SaaS companies go to market and sell.
- Familiarity with B2B SaaS sales and success incentive programs and key B2B SaaS sales and success metrics.
- Demonstrated background in analytical roles (Sales Ops, BizOps, Growth, Consulting, Finance, etc.).
