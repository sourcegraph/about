# Tech Operations Manager

We are looking for a leader, an engineer, and an operator to build and improve our Tech Operations team. As we grow our team and customer base rapidly, we need your help building, upgrading, and maintaining the internal applications that are straining to keep up!

## Responsibilities

You will help accelerate our team by owning a wide range of internal applications and processes in the short-term, and you will build a team to own these capabilities in the long-term. Example projects that the Tech Ops team would own include:

### Evaluating and implementing single sign-on software to make onboarding smoother.

Today, we maintain a series of lists of tools that new hires need to be added to. This list is split across a half-dozen internal [handbook pages](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/people-ops/onboarding) and project boards. Team channels are full of new teammates asking questions like "can someone add me to HubSpot?", and when someone leaves, the whole manual process is repeated in reverse.

### Building and deploying internal tools and bots.

You will help build and deploy in-house tools that we rely on. These cover a wide groundâ€”e.g. our [docs site generator](https://github.com/sourcegraph/docsite), Slack bots to notify our Customer Engineering team when a customer's usage has surpassed their license or when their license is about to expire, scripts to automatically [generate monthly tracking issues](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/labels/tracking), GitHub bots for enforcing CLA compliance, and more.

### Coordinating software implementation with outside contractors.

We use a number of enterprise-grade SaaS tools internally, including our CRM (Salesforce), marketing (HubSpot), and ERP software (Xero). Implementation and management of these is an ongoing task, and we are facing several large migrations in the coming months. You would help in all phases, including overseeing outside contractors where needed.

### Connecting and automating parts of our user journey.

You will help develop connections between the applications that our users interact with. For example, connecting our product to our billing systems so customers can renew automatically, connecting our user satisfaction surveys to our marketing tools, and [automating the quote-to-cash experience](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/sales/sales_to_ce_handover#finance-and-operations-responsibilities) for our sales team.

## Qualifications

- Excitement for software development and [our mission to make it so that everyone can code](https://about.sourcegraph.com/company/strategy).
- Experience working in implementation, engineering, IT, training, or other roles with internal "customers."
- 2+ years as a team leader or manager.
- Some software development experience, with an interest in learning and doing more.
- Be a self-starter. We are a small team, and we are counting on you to help identify and prioritize where you can have the greatest impact.
