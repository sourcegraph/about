## Reporting

### Fiscal years

A fiscal year is a one-year period that corporations like Sourcegraph use for accounting and budgeting. Sourcegraph's fiscal year runs from February 1 to January 31. Having our fiscal year offset by one month from the calendar year ensures that our fiscal Q4 doesn't end during December holidays, making our quarters more even and predictable, and eliminating pre-New Year stress for our sales, finance, and other teammates.

**Fiscal years that don't align with calendar years (such as our fiscal year) are referred to by the year in which the period ends**.

### Fiscal year 2022
- **FY22 Q1**: 01 February, 2021 - 30 April, 2021
- **FY22 Q2**: 01 May, 2021 - 31 July, 2021
- **FY22 Q3**: 01 August, 2021 - 31 October, 2021
- **FY22 Q4**: 01 November, 2021 - 31 January, 2022

## Definitions

### ARR

Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) is the dollar value of contracted recurring revenue in a (normalized) one-year period.

ARR includes committed [bookings](#booking) with contract start dates that fall in the first 15 days of the following calendar month. This allows Sourcegraph sales team members to get credit for renewals and expansions that may fall in the (near) future. Exceptions to this require written approval from the VP of Operations and the VP of Sales.

### IARR

Incremental [ARR](#arr) (IARR) is the change in ARR from one period to another.

### New IARR

New [IARR](#iarr) is IARR from *new customers* (i.e., organizations that were **not** existing customers at the beginning of the period). See also [expansion IARR](#expansion-iarr).

### Expansion IARR

Expansion [IARR](#iarr) is IARR from *existing customers* (i.e., organizations that were already customers at the beginning of the period).

If within a single period a new customer signs a contract which then grows in ARR before the end of the period, the total ending ARR is all considered [new IARR](#new-iarr), not expansion IARR. For example, if Acme Corp signs a $100k contract on February 3 and then the contract expands to $200k on March 5, all $200k would be considered new IARR for Q1.

### Booking

A booking is when a customer commits to pay us money. This includes when:

- A new customer just started paying self-service or signed a contract
- An existing customer (depending on their contract) takes an action that increases the amount of revenue we will earn from them (such as growing usage or using more premium features)
- An existing customer renews (including when the renewal is for the same ARR as the previous period)

### Financial Planning and Financial Statement Review

We update our financial plan on a quarterly basis. Our plan covers a twelve-month period and is focused on providing insights into working capital management, as well as predicting and understanding key trends within our business. 

We work with the head of each department in order to update the financial plan.

Following month two of every quarter, we complete a detailed dive in the current quarter actuals versus plan. Our philosophy is to compare our forecasts to results, so that we can constantly improve our forecasting methodologies and approaches to hold ourselves accountable. Additionally, this process drives accountability to the business owners of the budget. We focus on variances that exceed both 5% and $20k thresholds. We use this exercise to determine completeness over our financial statement close process, and also to understand if there is any activity causing fluctuations that we will need to revise on a go-forward basis. This exercise is completed at week 3 and 4 of the Month 3, in a given quarter. Once the quarter is closed, we also complete a detailed review of our plan vs. actual results. This analysis is completed at both a departmental level and a GL account level. We provide detailed explanations for variances that exceed both 5% and $20k thresholds.

We also complete a balance sheet review. This review is focused on providing analysis on key financial statement line items such as Cash, AR, AP, Accruals, and Deferred Revenue. We have a number of methods for analyzing the activity on these accounts.

## Accounting

We work with an outsourced accounting firm named [Officengine](https://officengine.com/). They close the books monthly and produce our financial statements, and provide support in processing payables, preparing taxes, filing corporate registrations, and more.
