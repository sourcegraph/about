### Billing

Each month, [expansion and MAU amounts are calculated](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tRcz3bNOho1TyWvrYSv37RIYcQs7I0i05-5eKwLq8TI/edit#gid=0) and sent as invoices through Xero. 

## Accounting

We work with an outsourced accounting firm named [Officengine](https://officengine.com/). They close the books monthly and produce our financial statements, and provide support in processing payables, preparing taxes, filing corporate registrations, and more. 

Reach out to Dan for an introduction if needed.

### Getting invoices paid

If you intend to make a purchase that will be paid by invoice (e.g., if it's too large to pay by credit card), send it to [ap@sourcegraph.com](mailto:ap@sourcegraph.com). The finance & accounting team will ask any questions as needed, and submit it for payment.
