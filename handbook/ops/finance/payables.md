# Paying bills

## Limits

Generally, you should feel free to spend in ways that are in the best interest of the business (see our philosophy in [spending company money](../../people-ops/spending-company-money.md)). 

However, if you intend to make a purchase above the limits below, please seek approval from your direct manager or, if necessary, [contact the finance team](index.md#contact)

|Role|Maximum expense without management approval|Maximum expense without finance approval|
|---|---|---|
|Department leads (VP-level or above)|$15,000|$20,000|
|Managers|$2,500|$5,000|
|All team members|$500|$1,000|

## Corporate credit cards

Managers and above are eligible to receive corporate credit cards for team purchases. We use [Brex](https://brex.com), which allows you to receive a physical card, or to use a virtual card if desired.

Just [contact the finance team](index.md#contact) if you believe you are eligible for one and would like to have one. By default, the following monthly limits apply, but they can be raised if requested.

|Role|Default monthly credit limit|
|---|---|
|Department leads (VP-level or above)|$10,000|
|Managers|$1,000|

## Getting invoices paid

If you intend to make a purchase that will be paid by invoice (e.g., if it's too large to pay by credit card), send it to [ap@sourcegraph.com](mailto:ap@sourcegraph.com). The finance & accounting team will ask any questions as needed, and submit it for payment.
