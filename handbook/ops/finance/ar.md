# Sourcegraph Accounts Receivable Policy

## Purpose:

The purpose of this accounts receivable policy is to outline how to properly bill customers and collect payment from outstanding accounts by collaborating efficiently with the sales team and prioritizing positive customer relationships.

## Defining Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable (AR) is the balance of money due to Sourcegraph but not yet paid for by customers. Accounts receivable is listed on our balance sheet as a current asset. An account receivable balance arises when the Finance team issues an invoice via Xero after a deal is won in Salesforce. The invoice is generated based on the terms of the signed customer agreement. An invoice for an expansion can also be based upon written customer approval (i.e. via signed order form). Sourcegraph customer agreements typically require payment at the beginning of the service term (i.e. net 30 days). The balance is reduced when payment is received, an invoice is voided, or an invoice is credited. 

## Efficiency in Billings

The Finance team has identified invoicing delays occur primarily due to missing contact or PO information. As such, these delays can be resolved by sales teams performing the following:

-Ensuring the correct email address and contact information for the customer billing contact

-Determining whether a PO is required and, if required, having secured the PO at time of invoice.
