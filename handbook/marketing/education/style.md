# Sourcegraph Learn Style Guide

The Developer Education team maintains a platform of content and code at [learn.sourcegraph.com](https://learn.sourcegraph.com).

_This document is a living and collaborative document and will be iterated upon and expanded._

## Educational resources

## Resource types

Sourcegraph Learn is building a library of several different resource types. Different topics demand different genres. Below, find the current educational resource types that are on the Learn platform.

| Resource type       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Example                                                                                                                                  |

| Procedural tutorial | A how-to or similar procedural article which takes a reader through an entire technical process from start to finish. Readers should be able to copy and paste code snippets. These resources will front-load any assumptions made in a prerequisites section and will provide context along the way.              | [How To Add Private Code Repositories to Sourcegraph](https://learn.sourcegraph.com/how-to-add-private-code-repositories-to-sourcegraph) |
| Conceptual guide    | A high-level technical guide that introduces concepts to readers without providing procedural examples.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | _Coming soon_                                                                                                                            |
| Cheat sheet         | Cheat sheets are less contextualized than other tutorials, supporting developers in recalling syntax with code examples that work. These guides will assume familiarity with the technology and are for more experienced developers who need to remember how to do something in a given programming language, etc. | [How To Search Code with Sourcegraph â€” A Cheat Sheet](https://learn.sourcegraph.com/sourcegraph-cheat-sheet)                             |
| Quickstart video    | A short-form video on a self-contained procedural topic demonstrated through video and audio with closed captioning and transcript.                                                                                                                                                                                | [Three Ways to Search with Sourcegraph (Video)](https://learn.sourcegraph.com/three-ways-to-search-video)                                |
