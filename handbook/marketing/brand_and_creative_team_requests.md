# Brand and Creative Team Requests

1. You send an email to brand@sourcegraph.com. (Coming soon: Google forms for Tier 3 & 4 requests!)
1. We read it and reply with one of three most likely options:
	1. We’re able to support the work directly and will schedule a kickoff or request more information;
	1. We’re able to support indirectly and will help source and manage a vendor;
	1. We’re unable to support right now and will connect you directly with a trusted vendor, contractor, or other resource (such as a template).
1. If we’re able to support your request directly or indirectly, we send you an Asana Form with a few fill-in-the-blank questions that automatically generates a Project Card for us.
1. If we aren’t able to support, we will facilitate an introduction to a trusted partner from our Preferred Vendor Network (PVN) of creative partners.
1. We meet with you and your team to gather more info for a Creative Brief, which will include the background, goals, timelines, budget, and other important resources.
