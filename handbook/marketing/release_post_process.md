# Release post process

Product marketing is responsible for creating the monthly release post in collaboration with the product and content teams. Here is an overview of the process: 

**10 days before release ships**

- Product marketing generates the release post template with placeholder section for highlights 

**7 days before release ships**

- PMs to recommend which updates to feature and provide draft copy and assets (videos, links, screenshots) for all highlights directly to the PR.
- If assets aren't ready, PM to add a placeholder for expected assets.

**Up until release ships**

- VP Product runs the script to generate changelog and merges it into the release template. 
- If necessary, PMs make edits to the changelog based on what was actually shipped.
- PMs add final assets.
- Product marketing to package and draft the release post and share with Rebecca and Christina for review. 

**0-2 days after release ships**

- No new additions or edits from the product team
- Managing Editor edits and publishes release post.
