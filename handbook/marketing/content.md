# Content marketing 

At Sourcegraph, we define **content marketing** as generating awareness, building trust, and nurturing our relationship with the developer community and enterprise buyers by providing interesting, relevant, and valuable content. This definition explains why we create content and who we create it for. 

**Content strategy** dives a layer deeper to include the governance and operations of content: how we generate, validate, and approve ideas; how we ensure quality and consistency; where we distribute content; how we measure performance; and how we update, revise, and retire content.

## Editorial process 

Writing is a process, and thus, our publishing guidelines are designed to aid the writer in producing their best work while staying on track with the publishing schedule. Pitches and first drafts can vary greatly in format and completeness. Some people like to create an outline for their first draft, others prefer to just start writing. The more you write, the more familiar you will get with your own writing process. What’s important is that you write multiple drafts and get feedback on them. This is how ideas turn into fully formed, thoughtful articles. 

It’s important to have a publishing schedule so that we can deliver relevant content to our audience at relevant times. The editorial team strategically manages our publishing calendar to optimize article views and engagement. For example, if you are writing an article on Go and GopherCon is two months away, we can time the release of your article to coincide with other activity around the conference. This has the potential to bring more attention and readers to your post while the topic is trending. 

### Guidelines for contributing to Sourcegraph’s blog

Please follow these guidelines when contributing to Sourcegraph’s blog. 

First, decide how you want to contribute:

1. If you have an original article idea that you want to write, start by submitting your pitch as an issue to the [blog post tracker](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/128). Add the labels `blog` and `marketing` and assign it to yourself.  
1. If you have an idea to submit but you don't want to write it, submit your idea as an issue to the blog post tracker and add the label `open proposal`. This signals to other contributors that your idea is open for anyone to write on it. 
1. If you want to write on an existing idea, choose an issue labeled `open proposal`, assign yourself, and leave comment explaining why you want to write this article. 

The editorial team will triage pitches weekly on Monday. Once you have submitted a pitch:

1. An editor will be assigned and will give you feedback on your idea.
1. The pitch is approved by you and your editor, and a publishing schedule is created. 
1. First draft is submitted by the first draft deadline. 
1. An editor and/or peer reviewer is completed by the first draft review deadline. Please reference the [peer review template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KHFMIGmbmDPsE8EYPAf4DPD6kek_1dRnKf49wG5foU0/edit) when conducting your review. You do not need to answer every reflection question. This is a guide to help you provide useful and actionable feedback to the author. 
1. A second draft is submitted. This may be your final draft depending on its polish and completeness. If there are major outstanding structural and/or mechanical issues, your editor may request a third draft.
1. The editor does a final copyedit.
1. Once the final draft is approved by you and your editor, it will be staged and/or scheduled for release. 

**What happens if I want to write something on my own, on my own time for Sourcegraph’s blog?** Once you’re ready for an editor’s review, submit your draft in place of a pitch and follow the article submission guidelines. An editor will reach out to you with feedback, requested changes, and publishing options. Please note that immediate publishing may not be available. If you would like to publish on your own schedule, [Medium](https://medium.com/) is a great option for self-publishing.
