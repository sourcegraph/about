# Sourcegraph messaging

## What problems does Sourcegraph solve?

Enterprises must build software to survive and thrive, but it's difficult:

- Codebases are very large and growing quickly.
- Code is becoming more complex and interdependent.
- Application security, privacy, and compliance are more important than ever.
- The amount of legacy code is growing.
- Attracting, training, onboarding, and retaining software engineers is becoming harder.
- The software lifecycle relies on more tools, vendors, and specialized roles than ever.

Key processes in the software lifecycle are slow, manual, and cumbersome:

- Understanding how code works (to fix or enhance it)
- Reusing existing code
- Fixing insecure code across a large codebase
- Migrating away from legacy code

(Also see "[Personas](../product/personas.md)".)
