# Brand Guidelines

>All notes in ***italized bold text*** 

Our brand is at the root of everything we do. It’s how we behave, communicate, look, and interact, across digital and real-world touch-points. Each element of our brand works together to demonstrate who we are and what we believe in. We express our brand through our brand story, brand voice, and brand visuals. 

Everything defined in our brand guide — from typeface, to color, to texture — is carefully chosen to visually represent our brand.
