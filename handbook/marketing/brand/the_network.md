# The Network

## Sourcegraph Preferred Vendor Network (aka The Network)
The Brand team maintains a list of approved or contracted vendors + agencies. Some of them we work with on an ongoing basis, and some we donâ€™t, but either way we are available for intros, scoping, or estimates. All of these vendors have either been vetted by the Brand team, previously contracted, or are a direct referral from an employee or trusted partner. 

If for any reason our team is unable to support individual requests for creative (either directly or indirectly), we will happily facilitate an introduction to a recommended and trusted vendor to ensure that your project is attended to with the utmost care and quality, and stay close to the work throughout to ensure a successful project or program. 

## About the Network
Though our permanent full-time team may be smaller, we pull in experts, specialists, and extra help when needed to quickly and dramatically scale the volume and scope of the work we do. We do this by maintaining relationships with the best in the business in various fields, such as video production, storytelling, social media, community, web design, and merch. The vendors from our network flow in and out of our team as needed, and disperse when appropriate, in order to efficiently manage the ebbs and flow of business needs with little to no service disruption.
