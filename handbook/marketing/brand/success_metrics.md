# Success Metrics

What can we/should we be capturing to identify successes and areas for improvement when we look back on 2021?

**Analytics Status:** Working with Marketing, Sales, and People teams to better understand the most critical metrics to monitor and optimize for, after which we will build an initial set of universal dashboards to test data flow and accuracy. Once established, we will work with the Marketing Ops lead (open role) to set up individual dashboards to track each campaign and generate automatic and one-time reports for read-outs.

**Process Metrics Status:** We use Asana and Harvest tor project management and time tracking. At the end of each quarter, we can prepare an analysis of internal process benchmarks to provide improvement targets.

Examples of process metrics include:

- Job types (Projects per tier per quarter)
- Milestone schedules (% of hitting each milestone)
- Staff utilization (as a %); creative vs administrative time
- On-time delivery rate (final deadline)
- Error rate (should be zero)
- Average rounds of revisions (1-2 is target)
- Rounds of creative (less is better, should decrease over time)
- Speed to market (avg. time to delivery)
- Volume and frequency of rush requests (“P0s”) handled
- AEV (Agency Equivalency Value): Cost saving of in-house vs Agency supported
- Project Volume (total # and total hrs.)
- External Agency Spend
- Volume of requests per team/individual
