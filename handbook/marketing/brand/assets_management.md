# Asset Management

Later in 2021, will be using a tool called Brandfolder to store and manage access to our final, approved files and brand assets, with the ability to share folders with external partners and ensure version control for team-wide use. In the meantime, Google Drive will be the shared source for currently-in-production and in-use files plus final assets and brand identity files.

> Here is our top-level [link to brand folder] in the Sourcegraph team drive

> Here is our externally-accessible [link to shared drive] — Sourcegraph-Brand Design (ext shared) — for when we need to share or receive files from vendors. After a design is approved in Asana, final files and working files should be uploaded to the appropriate vendor folder in the Shared Drive.

## Naming Convention
(asset name) + (category) + (version) + (file type)  
Looks like: Asset-Name-category-version.xxx  
Example in practice: Sales-Pitch-Deck-v7.ppt; POC-Kickoff-1sheet-v3.pdf  
Note: Dates, names, descriptions and other important info is stored as metadata and any file notes can be added in Get Info. When we launch Brandfolder some of this will be auto-generated using AI and machine learning.

## Example Categories
Brochure  
Banner  
Social (incl. Platform abbreviation and type, such as Header, Preview, Card, Story, etc.; dimensions are captured in metadata of the file): TW=Twitter; IG=Instagram, LI=LinkedIn, GD=Glassdoor, YT=YouTube, DS=Discord, TH=Twitch, RD=Reddit  
One-sheets  
Business Card  
Letterhead  
Swag (Include shirt, mug, socks, etc. if designed for a specific item)  
Stickers  
Deck  

## Foldering System

File Locations  
Google Drive - All finished photography in appropriate subfolders; finished videos* and cutdowns; print and digital design conceptual and finished files; finished audio files. Google Drive is our library of assets (for now, Brandfolder coming soon). All videos and photos should be stored in the main Brand folder, organized by content type and main use case. Any assets that have expired usage dates, or are simply outdated due to personnel or messaging changes, should be archived and labelled as such. We should scrub the drive quarterly to ensure freshness of content. Working files will be stored in Drive as well in a separate folder tree labelled Working Files. Backups will be held at 3 offsite locations on external drives.

Some videos created in collaboration with partners may only be sharable for limited time periods, i.e. weeks, months, or years. Please add notes in the Description section of the file after uploading to the appropriate location in Drive, and set an expiration date for sharing privileges if sharing outside of the team.  
Select the file in Drive to open this submenu, then ‘Add a description’

Brandfolder - raw photos and finished video projects archive, including SRT (captions) files; edited and approved photos; copies of print-ready and digital final approved designs (one-pagers, flyers, banners, social graphics, etc.); brand assets for sharing with partners and third parties (limited access). Brandfolder is not like the National Archives for our digital media. The content inside that is accessible to internal and external users should always be considered final and approved, but everything (including raw, unedited video footage) should be stored on physical drives for long-term archival storage as well as maintaining a cloud-based backup.

In-house RAID - original, unedited raw video footage video backup, including .mx4 and .r3d file formats; hard drive backups of all raw photography and audio files. Hard copy backups of all files located at two locations (since we are fully remote, likely locations include at homes of Producer, Editor and Creative Director).
