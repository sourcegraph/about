## Branded swag

Welcome to our Gifting Guidelines Page! Have a request for custom swag? Use the [Swag Request Form](https://app.asana.com/0/1200419124213353/list).

>Note that adding new items to out inventory can take around 8+ weeks if a custom design is being created and applied to the item vs our standard branding and logo applications.

>Make sure that you comply with our [anti-corruption/anti-bribery policy](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/people-ops/anti-corruption) and reach out to #legal slack channel or legal@sourcegraph.com with any questions. 

**Branded swag** are lower-cost items with our logo on them. This includes socks, stickers, notebooks, t-shirts and tumblers. It is a great way to thank someone for advocating for Sourcegraph in their company, or to recognize something special that they have done for us or our community. These items are available through [Printfection](https://www.printfection.com/swag/) with weight- and location-based global shipping.

All items in our inventory are the same ones found in our new hire kits, but not all of the items are available as user or customer swag due to cost and inventory limits.



### Use cases

- As a thank you gift for attending an event
- To strengthen the bond after a demo
- Customers’ who we’d like to make a personal connection with
- As a welcome gift once a buyer closes a large sale
- To active community members that have contributed actionable, useful feedback on Sourcegraph products
- Someone who has advocated for Sourcegraph’s adoption at their current company
- Those who participated in a Sourcegraph-hosted event as a guest or speaker (virtual chat, panel discussion, podcast, web series guest, and similar)

Please use your best judgment and request swag when you need it and it’s in the interest of the company. Remember, Sourcegraph doesn’t have unlimited funds—spend this money as if it was your own. Learn more about [Spending Company Money](https://about-docsite.sourcegraph.com/handbook/people-ops/spending-company-money#spending-company-money) in The Handbook. Budgetary guidelines for individual teams and departments will be provided next year so that teams have higher agency in terms of swag spend.
