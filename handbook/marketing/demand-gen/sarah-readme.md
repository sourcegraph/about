There's a reason we're not a lead gen team. We're not creating leads; we're creating _demand_.
When I talk about demand here, I'm talking about the economic principle which refers to a person's desire to purchase and willingness to pay, ideally, a premium. Demand is created with positioning, imagery, contexts, language. It's all about the vibe, y'know?
When I think of demand gen, our job is to amplify a compelling brand and high-value product by orchestrating placement, positioning, and timing. If everything is in alignment, people will naturally raise their hands to be part of what we're doing.

### [](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/demand-gen/sarah-readme#preferred-learning-styles '#preferred-learning-styles')Preferred learning styles

I prefer to take in information verbally (through written or spoken word), process information for myself visually (love a whiteboard or blank sheet of printer paper), and master information physically (by doing or teaching).

### [](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/demand-gen/sarah-readme#communication-style '#communication-style')Communication style

I default to open, direct conversation. It's guaranteed I have a point of view in most situations and I will often share freely. I am conscious of creating space for others to weigh in first as I can easily be the person who is quick to volunteer an answer or opinion. I can be a bit of a Hermione Granger, if you know what I mean.

A well-written RFC is a delight to read, review, and comment in.
I also love what I call a "jam sesh" - an informal small-group conversation to work through something.

### [](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/demand-gen/sarah-readme#how-i-approach-problems '#how-i-approach-problems')How I approach problems

I am painfully curious. I look for clarity and will go deep in researching a subject to validate my intuition and form a solid perspective. Emotional cues are just as important as facts to me. I want to understand _how_ someone shared something, not just what they shared, y'know? Context is key.

I love surprises.

### [](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/demand-gen/sarah-readme#thoughts-feelings-preferences-when-it-comes-to-asking-for-help '#thoughts-feelings-preferences-when-it-comes-to-asking-for-help')Thoughts/feelings/preferences when it comes to asking for help

If you're asking me for help, I'm best able to serve when I understand the context of the situation (all the details) and what exactly you're looking for my perspective on. When asking for help myself, I often structure my comms with a TL;DR to start and then a breakdown of the what (the situation with details), what I think we should do, the potential impacts I've identified, and other considered-but-not-recommended options.

My best days are the ones where I've learned something new, solved a really tricky problem, or felt real, human connection.

I like to bucket my time by day-of-week rather than time-of-day because I find calls to be really disruptive to my personal flow. I'm one of those people who, if I have an appointment at 1pm, it's almost impossible for me to do anything productive in the hours beforehand (turns out [I'm not alone](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/k5g4go/if_i_have_an_appointment_scheduled_i_literally/)). Calls do the same thing for me during the workday. I prefer to get all of my calls out of the way first thing in the morning or lump them into a single day. I try to keep Mondays and Fridays free of meetings for this reason.

Maintaining boundaries around Slack and email is pretty easy for me. Send away and know I'll respond when I'm back online.

Acknowledge it. "You seem a little off. Is anything going on?"

Lack of clarity is a quick way to send me into a spiral. I can handle just about anything if I have access to the right information and clarity around the why/what it's for.
