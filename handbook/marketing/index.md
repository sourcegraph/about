## Definitions

### Web traffic

Web traffic is measured by analyzing two metrics: [all users](https://www.lovesdata.com/blog/google-analytics-glossary#user) and [organic users](https://theupperranks.com/blog/organic-search/). Unless otherwise noted, web traffic refers to web visitors from the United States and Canada. If the web traffic is labeled `geo7` or similar, it refers to the web traffic from the US, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, Germany, France and Sweden.   Also note, that web traffic currently includes the following sites:  about.sourcegraph.com and info.sourcegraph.com.

### Inquiry

An inquiry is a person who has requested information from Sourcegraph for the first time and has provided Sourcegraph with at least an email address. This may be online via a web form, or in person, for example, at a conference. Someone may become an inquiry and a [MQL](#mql) at the same time, or may take years between converting from an inquiry to a [MQL](#mql).

### MQL

A marketing qualified lead (MQL) is any of:

- A person who fills out a demo request form AND self-reports an engineering team of >100 or has a title containing `Director`, `Manager`, `VP`, `Vice President`, `Senior`, `Sr`, 	`Head`, `Lead`, `CTO` or `Chief Technology Offier`
- A person who sets up a new Sourcegraph instance with a business email (personal email domains and .edu addresses do not qualify)
