## Weekly marketing meeting

The marketing team will have a weekly meeting (schedule TBD), with notes written in [Marketing meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HI4mo99ESQMnlkilP_OJuH0acKHYA8bDxOK7s-no4X4/edit#) (and we're on step 1 of a [structured meeting](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/communication#structured-meetings)).

## Definitions

### Web traffic

Web traffic is measured by analyzing two metrics: [all users](https://www.lovesdata.com/blog/google-analytics-glossary#user) and [organic users](https://theupperranks.com/blog/organic-search/). Unless otherwise noted, web traffic refers to web visitors from the United States and Canada. If the web traffic is labeled `geo7` or similar, it refers to the web traffic from the US, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, Germany, France and Sweden. Also note, that web traffic currently includes the following sites: about.sourcegraph.com and info.sourcegraph.com.

### Inquiry

An inquiry is a person who has requested information from Sourcegraph for the first time and has provided Sourcegraph with at least an email address. This may be online via a web form, or in person, for example, at a conference. Someone may become an inquiry and a [MQL](#mql) at the same time, or may take months between converting from an inquiry to a [MQL](#mql).

### Interesting inquiry

Any inquiry that works for a company with > $10M in revenue, or specifies that there are 200+ software engineers at their company will be highlighted as 'interesting'.

### MQL

A marketing qualified lead (MQL) is any of:

- A person who submits a demo or contact form AND has >= 200 engineers
- A person who sets up a new Sourcegraph instance AND >= 2,000 employees
- A person downloads an eBook or white paper AND has >= 500 engineers and/or >= 2,000 employees

[Specific email domains](https://app.hubspot.com/property-settings/2762526/properties?action=edit&property=inbound_scoring_qualification&search=inbou&type=0-1) are excluded.
