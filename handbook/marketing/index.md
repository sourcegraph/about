### Inquiry

An inquiry is a person who has requested information from Sourcegraph for the first time and has provided Sourcegraph with at least an email address. This may be online via a web form, or in person, for example, at a conference. Someone may become an inquiry and a [MQL](#mql) at the same time, or may take years between converting from an inquiry to a [MQL](#mql).

### MQL

A marketing qualified lead (MQL) is any of:

- A person who fills out a demo request form
- A person who fills out a free trial form
- A person who fills out a form requesting to speak with a Sourcegraph representative
