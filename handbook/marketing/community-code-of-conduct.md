The Sourcegraph community is the place to ask questions, seek guidance, share solutions and best practices with your fellow Sourcegraph community members. Sourcegraph encourages its community members to learn from each other and share knowledge because we want the community to be a valuable resource and a place where everyone grows and learns together.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by Sourcegraph. This includes IRC, the mailing lists, the issue tracker, events, and any other forums created by the Sourcegraph team which the community uses for communication. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them. If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing [community@sourcegraph.com](mailto:community@sourcegraph.com).

## COMMUNICATION STANDARDS FOR THE COMMUNITY

- Help improve the discussion.
- Help make the Sourcegraph community a great place for knowledge sharing by always working to improve the discussion in some way, however small. Before you post, ask yourself if you are sure your post adds to the conversation, if not, think over it and come back later.
- The topics discussed matter to all of us. Be respectful of the topics, the time it takes to craft a question and the people discussing them, even if you disagree.
- Be friendly and patient.
- We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
- Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the Sourcegraph community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the Sourcegraph community.

### Improve the community through participation

- Help make the technical community a better place by sharing your expertise. You may have just the right answer that somebody else is looking for, so don’t be shy about adding your insights to the conversation.
- Use the Slack reactions to emphasize and encourage questions and their answers.
- Point the moderators to posts and articles which require improvement.
- You are responsible for the community space, alongside our moderators. With your help, moderators can be community facilitators.
- If you see bad behavior, don’t encourage this behavior by acknowledging it with a reply. Just flag it, by notifying our community moderators. Action will be taken as soon as possible.

### Think before posting

- Reasonable, well thought-out and detailed posts help other community members understand what is being asked or explained. When expressing negative views, take a deep breath and review what’s being said before posting to ensure the post is both constructive and respectful of others.
- When posting a link please confirm it is not malicious and is valid.
- When posting a question please ensure to include all relevant information.
- When posting an answer please make sure to include all relevant details, one sentence answers rarely help resolve a question!
- Be careful in the words that you choose. We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
  - Violent threats or language directed against another person.
  - Discriminatory jokes and language.
  - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
  - Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
  - Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
  - Unwelcome sexual attention.
  - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
  - Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.

### Promotions and Commercial Solicitations are not allowed

- In order to preserve the integrity of community, content and activities consisting of advertising, promotion (different to open source solutions), or solicitation (whether direct or indirect) is not allowed, including:
  - Creating, modifying, or posting content regarding your (or your relative’s, close friend’s, business associate’s, or employer’s) products or services.
  - Creating, modifying, or posting content regarding your competitors’ products or services.
  - Creating, modifying, or posting content in exchange for compensation of any kind (including free or discounted products, refunds, or reimbursements) or on behalf of anyone else.
  - Offering compensation or requesting compensation (including free or discounted products) in exchange for creating, modifying, or posting content.
  - Posting advertisements or solicitations, including URLs with referrer tags or affiliate codes.

### Protect your Personal Information

- Protect your personal information and sensitive information. Keep in mind that your information is viewed by every member of the community.
- Moderators try to keep the forum a safe environment to post, and may remove any posts that reveal sensitive information such as addresses, passwords, or other private information.

For any other issues not covered here we encourage our community members to provide us with direct feedback by directly raising it as an issue, or sending a PR.
