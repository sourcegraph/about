# Business Operations

The Business Operations (BizOps) team is responsible for [translating business goals (strategy) into tactical operations (execution)](https://medium.com/business-startup-development-and-more/why-your-startup-also-needs-a-bizops-team-5d2e7d436a0).

# Analytics

This page describes Sourcegraph's analytics function, our data sources, and how to use our data tools.

To reach us, mention @ericbm in the most relevant channel (i.e. #marketing for a marketing-related question).

## Submitting a data request

**Projects:** Proposals to capture and report on new data are in [GitHub issues in the Sourcegraph analytics repository](https://github.com/sourcegraph/analytics/issues). Provide the following data to help us understand and prioritize your request:

- What is the purpose of the visualization?
- Will it be frequently used, or is it only needed sporadically?
- How does it support Sourcegraph's company and team OKRs?
- Do you know how you want the data visualized? If you need a new graph or chart, adding a photo of a sketch on paper helps immensely.
- When does this need to be delivered?
- How urgent is this request?

**Small asks and questions:** Post in the #analytics channel. 

If you need clarification or are not sure about any of the above, ask a question in the [Slack #analytics channel](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/CN4FC7XT4).

## Data sources

We collect data from the following:

* Google Analytics: Website analytics for Sourcegraph marketing and docs pages (not Sourcegraph.com)
* HubSpot: Marketing automation and CRM
* MixMax: Email marketing automation (Apollo is not used in production, but still retains data)
* Sourcegraph.com Site-admin pages: customer subscriptions and license keys
* [Pings](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/pings) from self-hosted Sourcegraph instances containing anonymous and aggregated information. There are [specific guidelines](../engineering/adding_ping_data.md) that must be followed for teams to add ping data. 
* [Custom tool to track events](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/5486) on the Sourcegraph.com instance
* [Prometheus dashboards](https://sourcegraph.com/-/debug/grafana/?orgId=1) show high-level insight into the health of a Sourcegraph instance to admins. Sourcegraph teammates can see the health of Sourcegraph.com. 

We have [written policies about how we handle customer information](customer_data_policy.md). 

## Data tools

* [Looker](#using-looker): Business intelligence/data visualization tool
* Google Cloud Platform: BigQuery is our data warehouse and the database Looker runs on top of
* Google Sheets: There are a [number of spreadsheets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vOyhFO90FjHe-bwnHOZeljHLuhXL2BAv)that Looker queries (by way of BigQuery).
* BizOps builds ad-hoc tools to analyze data for various reasons. The projects are in the [Google Drive Analytics folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13b2PJqiQzjLMrM2ZAjlsax0fT_DQlxFm) and the source code is available in the [analytics repo](https://github.com/sourcegraph/analytics).

### Data pipelines

Every underlying data source (not chart!) is assumed to always be up-to-date unless noted otherwise.

#### HubSpot

Every Sunday night or Monday morning, [BizOps scripts](https://github.com/sourcegraph/analytics/tree/master/HubSpot%20ETL) are triggered to retrieve data from HubSpot and upload it to BigQuery. As a result, HubSpot data in Looker is updated weekly, not daily.  If you need the latest data during the week, mention @ericbm in the #analytics channel in Slack.

[Lead-generation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16S3xlcY7DmpcfKZYD-3VHUsaPLiYHyisu8cD_gZpv0Q/edit#gid=0) from HubSpot is triggered by Zapier and is always up-to-date. [Marketing operations](../marketing/marketing_operations.md#maintaining-data-pipelines) has more information on lead-gen events. 

## Using Looker

[Looker](https://sourcegraph.looker.com/) is a self-service tool with many pre-built reports and visualizations. Read our instructions for [getting started with Looker](#using-looker) and reach out in the #analytics Slack channel if you have any questions.

**Looker boards**

- [Go-to-market](https://sourcegraph.looker.com/browse/boards/2)<br/>
- [Product/engineering](https://sourcegraph.looker.com/browse/boards/5)<br/>

These two boards will contain 99% of what you're looking in Looker. We recommend adding them to your account (this will pop-up on the top of the page if you haven't already added them) to simplify your Looker navigation. If what you're looking for is not on these boards, you can [explore the folders](https://sourcegraph.looker.com/folders/home). 

### Getting started with Looker

Looker provides tools for building and exploring custom reports and visualizations using custom fields captured from various Sourcegraph data sources. If you're a new user, here's where to get started.

To simplify navigation within Looker, adding the [go-to-market](https://sourcegraph.looker.com/browse/boards/2) and [product/engineering](https://sourcegraph.looker.com/browse/boards/5) boards to your list (the button under the board title).

- [Visualizing data](http://www.looker.com/docs/exploring-data/visualizing-query-results)
- [Building dashboards](http://www.looker.com/docs/exploring-data/building-dashboards)

### Querying Looker data

Looker created a query language called [LookML](https://docs.looker.com/data-modeling/learning-lookml/what-is-lookml) for defining calculations and data relationships in a SQL database. The 'Explores' and other functionality you see in Looker is all based on a LookML model.  The average Sourcegraph teammate should not need to write any LookML code, but should you need or want to, here are some resources to get started.

- [LookML Terms and Concepts](http://www.looker.com/docs/data-modeling/learning-lookml/lookml-terms-and-concepts)
