# Evaluating values in an interview

We expect every teammate, team, and our company to live up to the [Sourcegraph values](../../../company/values.md). It is therefore important that we evaluate every candidate on the values to determine how successful they will be within Sourcegraph.

We are actively working on creating a formal process for values interviewing ([Ops RFC 7](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d1a53dEP-k5Qsjv7BOAGq9lg4RL4Br7wg-weglJjHwY/edit)) to create a structured set of questions that are used consistently across the organization to evaluate value alignment.

## Rubric

In the short-term, the Product team is experimenting with having a values score card inside of feedback forms that uses the following rubric:

| Score | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 👎👎 | Abundant evidence that this person 's behavior isn't aligned with this value. |
| 👎 | Evidence that this person 's behavior isn't aligned with this value.  |
| 👍 | Demonstrated this value with evidence. |
| 👍👍 | Exceptionally demonstrated this value, with abundant evidence. |

There is a text box for filling in any notes about the above value ratings.

If your interview did not get signal on a value (or if you got conflicting signals), then you can choose to not rate the value and instead share your thoughts in the open text box.
