# Reference checks

As part of our hiring process, we conduct a reference check. We will request specific references prior to making an offer to the candidate and will inform them that references will be conducted by People Ops and the hiring manager within their first week.

We will conduct references calls within each new hire's first week at Sourcegraph. Ultimately, the goal behind our reference checks is to ensure that we are setting up the new hire for success, and doing them within their first week will keep reference calls from being a blocker for sending candidates their offer letter and establishing a start date.

## Reference requirements

Based on the candidate’s work experience, the hiring manager will request specific references from the candidate.

Requested references will typically be a former manager(s) and/or colleague(s) and may be from the candidate’s most recent or previous companies.

## Reference call

People Ops will reach out to each reference to schedule calls. People Ops will conduct the reference calls with the hiring manager present to address any potential concerns or follow-up questions.
