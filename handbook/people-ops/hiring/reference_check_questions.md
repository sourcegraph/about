# Reference checks

References will be requested by the hiring manager on a case by case basis and the hiring manager is responsible for deciding which specific references they would like to speak to based on the candidate's work experience and interview performance.

Ultimately, the goal behind our reference checks is to ensure that we are setting up the new hire for success and know how to best work with them.

## Reference requirements

Based on the candidate’s work experience, the hiring manager will request specific references from the candidate.

Requested references will typically be a former manager(s) and/or colleague(s) and may be from the candidate’s most recent or previous companies.

## Reference call

The recruiter will coordinate a calls with references and hiring managers. The recruiter will conduct the reference calls with the hiring manager present to address any potential concerns or follow-up questions.

## Reference call questions

* In what context did you two work together? What was your role/their role at the time?
* What would make [candidate] happy and motivated in a role?
* If you were writing their annual review today, where would they have an opportunity to improve or build on their skills?
* Do you have any advice for their future manager?
* Was there ever a time where [candidate] was disrespectful in any way to other members of the team?
* (HM then jumps in with any specific questions they have for the reference)
