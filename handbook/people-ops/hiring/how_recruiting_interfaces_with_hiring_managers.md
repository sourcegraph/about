# How recruiting interfaces with hiring managers

### Background
Level of support from recruiting differed from team to team. Need for transparency of support and responsibilities from recruiting. 

### Objective

To describe and understand ownership of responsibilities throughout the hiring process. 

### Capacity planning
The People Ops team’s goal is to maintain the following capacity ratios for fully onboarded recruiters. For now, these are directional only, and for guidance to hiring managers. In the future, these will be measured and treated as contracts.

- Engineering and product roles: 1 person in recruiting can be expected to hire 2–4 people per month
- Highly specialized or niche technical roles (e.g. security engineers): 1 person in recruiting can be expected to hire 1–2 people per month
- Go to market and G&A roles: 1 person in recruiting can be expected to hire 5–10 people per month
- Leadership roles: 1 person in recruiting can be expected to hire 1–2 people per month

### Ramp up time for new recruiters
60-80 days. In Q3, Lever says our average speed to get a person from the beginning of the process to hired (start date) is 62 days.

### Estimated timeline to first hire:
- Weeks 1-2 onboarding and meeting hiring managers
- Weeks 2-3 should start sourcing
- Weeks 3-4 start getting responses and doing recruiter screens
- Week 5 candidates starts doing assignments and initial screens
- Week 6 candidate goes through final interview rounds and debrief
- Week 7 offer and possible negotiations
- Week 8+ candidate notification period until start date

### Candidate life cycle 

- Outreach (passive candidates)
- Application review (active candidates)
- Recruiter screen
- Initial screen
- Assignment
- Interview
- Debrief
- Offer
- Reference checks
- Onboarding
