# Offboarding

> NOTE: This guide is for the People Ops team to manage teammate offboarding. To learn more about how departures are managed and communicated, consult the [leaving Sourcegraph](leaving.md) page.

## Announcing departures

Teammate departures will be announced in:
- The [company meeting](../communication/company_meeting.md) following the departure.
- In the #general channel in our team Slack

These announcements will be brief and won't go into details to protect the privacy of the departing teammate. If any teammates have additional questions, they can reach out to their manager, the departing teammate's manager, or the @sourcegraph/people-ops team.
