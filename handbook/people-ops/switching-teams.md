# Switching teams

Sourcegraph strives to support teammates who are interested in making career changes by switching teams, roles, and responsibilities.

This page focuses on the _process_ of moving from one team or department to another. Please reach out to your manager (or the [People Ops team](index.md)) to ask questions related to personal or career progress, how to evaluate such moves, resources, and more.

If you are interested in staying in the same department or team, or working for the same manager, but switching your focus (e.g. switching from frontend to backend software development), then this page is not needed—simply speak to your manager.

## Eligibility

For now, any member of the Sourcegraph team is eligible to request to switch teams.

However, certain circumstances can affect whether a team change is supported, including recent performance reviews, length of time on the team, ongoing projects, and more.

## Recommended process

This process is not fixed. If you believe pursuing any steps in a different order would benefit your unique circumstances, you can modify this.

- Collect your thoughts and prepare a simple proposal. Be able to answer questions like:
  1. How does this change align with your personal and career goals?
  1. What value can you bring to the new team? What role can you fill?
  1. Why now?
- Reach out to your current manager (or, if you're not comfortable doing so, the People Ops team) to discuss the idea. Ideally, your interest in the new role should not come as a complete surprise (e.g., your current manager should be aware of your careers goals).
  - If your manager doesn't support the move, you can reach out to the People Ops team to discuss options.
- With your manager's support, contact the head of the team you're interested in moving to to discuss the idea.
  - If the new team manager doesn't support the move, you can reach out to the People Ops team to discuss options.
- If both team managers support the change in principle, you will go through a [short internal interview process](#requirements-for-the-new-manager) for the role.
- If the internal interview concludes with positive results, the team switch can be planned.
- Once the transition plan is approved and the impacted teams informed of the switch, the teammate's new manager should [post an announcement](../communication/announcements.md).

## Requirements for the new manager

Team switches require a [job description](../talent/hiring/job_description_guidelines.md) to be drafted for the new role and confirmed by all parties to ensure alignment. The new manager should create this document.

New managers are strongly encouraged to run an internal interview process. Some parts of our standard interview process may not be needed (for example, the new manager already know whether the teammate would be an effective collaborator). But new managers should still test the teammate's ability to do the new job. So any role-specific projects and interviews should take place.

## Considerations

### Team changes must be clean

Teammates can’t be in split roles for any period of time, they can’t be responsible for finishing up some legacy projects after they switch, etc. Both the previous and new manager need to sign off on the date of transfer, and have all work fully handed off before that happens.

### Headcount and budgets transfer with the teammate

The team that the teammate departs would have a additional opening (or additional budget) for hiring, while the new team would now have a filled spot.

### Compensation and level may change

The teammate must accept that the new role may come with different compensation bands and leveling guides, and a teammate's specific compensation and level may not be transferable. The new role may come with higher or lower compensation, and that change will be reflected either way.
