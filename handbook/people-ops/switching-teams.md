# Applying for a new role in a new team

As Sourcegraph grows, we would like to support teammates who are interested in taking on new roles in other teams, if their skillset and aspirations are required in the team they wish to move to.

This page focuses on the _process_ of moving from one team or department to another. Please reach out to your manager (or the [People Ops team](index.md)) to ask questions related to personal or career progress, how to evaluate such moves, resources, and more.

If you are interested in staying in the same department or team, or working for the same manager, but switching your focus (e.g. switching from frontend to backend software development), then this page is not needed—simply speak to your manager and see if adjustments can be made to our current role, that align with the team's success.

## Eligibility

For now, any member of the Sourcegraph team is eligible to request to take on a new role in another team, however, support for the change will be subject to teammate's length of time and performance in their existing role, ongoing projects, and whether their skillset is a match for the new role.

## Recommended process

There is no fixed process for motivating to take on a new role, but we recommend you engage your current manager first and explain your motivation for applying for a move, including:

- What value you can bring to the new role
- How the change new role aligns with your skillset and personal/career goals
- When it would be appropriate to make the move

With your manager's support, contact the head of the team you're interested in moving to to discuss the thinking behind your application, as well as the details of the role and any compensation level.
If your manager or the manager of the new team don't support your motivation to move, for reasons you find unreasonable, you can reach out to the People Ops team for their perspective.
If both team managers support the change in principle, you will go through a [short internal interview process](#requirements-for-the-new-manager) for the role, and if you are successful, the team move can be planned. Once the transition plan is approved and the impacted teams informed of the switch, the teammate's new manager should [post an announcement](../communication/announcements.md).

## Requirements for the new manager

Team moves require a [job description](../talent/hiring/job_description_guidelines.md) to be drafted for the new role and confirmed by all parties to ensure alignment. The new manager should create this document.

New managers are strongly encouraged to run an internal interview process. Some parts of our standard interview process may not be needed (for example, the new manager already know whether the teammate would be an effective collaborator). But new managers should still test the teammate's ability to do the new job. So any role-specific projects and interviews should take place.

## Considerations

### Team moves must be clean

Teammates can’t be in split roles for any period of time, they can’t be responsible for finishing up some legacy projects after they switch, etc. Both the previous and new manager need to sign off on the date of transfer, and have all work fully handed off before that happens.

### Headcount and budgets transfer with the teammate

The team that the teammate departs would have a additional opening (or additional budget) for hiring, while the new team would now have a filled spot.

### Compensation and level may change

The teammate must accept that the new role may come with different compensation bands and leveling guides, and a teammate's specific compensation and level may not be transferable. The new role may come with higher or lower compensation, and that change will be reflected either way.
