# Company sponsored events (team and company-wide)


## Phase I: Teammate Travel Meetup Guidelines

As of June 16th 2021, we will resume reimbursing travel per our [team travel budgets](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/people-ops/travel#team-travel-budgets) for travel and in-person events that are permitted by law. We want this to be gradual, and all events must be small and completely optional. 

As an all-remote company, we want everyone to feel included and connected, regardless of where they're located. Choosing to travel or meet is an incredibly personal decision, and we support team members who may not be interested in meeting up at this time.


## **Guidelines:**

- To avoid the perception that these events are mandatory, managers should not organize events for their teams. 
   	- Managers can attend events and organize events that don't involve their direct reports.

-   Events should be outdoors rather than indoors.
    
-   Keep gatherings small. Use your best judgement and defer to local jurisdictions in determining the number of attendees.
    
-   Follow local laws, customs, and safety regulations during every step of the meetup process.

- Assume people don't want to shake hands, hug, high-five, etc. 
    
-   Don't ask about other people's private health choices or condition attendance on those factors (*such as vaccination status*).
    
***Please notify People Ops (people-ops@sourcegraph.com) before you start planning an event.***
    

## How we came to this decision:

Our policy until now has been to suspend travel/meetup reimbursement and for managers to not organize team events. *Why not a blanket "no meetup" policy?* On principle, we don't think any company can or should forbid people from meeting up on their personal time.  Although Covid-19 continues to deeply affect each person and region, we needed to establish a different policy to meet the team's needs. 82% of team members surveyed (49 respondents in May) said they'd feel comfortable attending an in-person meetup (*either now or within the next few months, with some conditions*), and 84% of team members said Sourcegraph should start allowing in-person team meetups and travel. With most team members in favor of starting to travel, we didn't want *only* local meetups (where people would not need travel reimbursement) to start, because that wouldn't be inclusive to people who don't live near other team members. We decided to change the policy to start allowing travel/meetup reimbursement but we are still asking managers to not organize team events. We'll be revisiting the manager planning component in Phase II of our Travel Meetup plan.

## Team travel budgets

Sourcegraph is an [all-remote](../company/remote/index.md) company. This means we all need to make an effort to travel to meet up in person and spend quality time with other team members all around the world.

Team meetups are very important for building cohesiveness in remote teams and spreading Sourcegraph culture across the company.

We want and expect you to use your full travel budgets described here each year! For this reason, they aren't transferrable, and unused budget doesn't roll over into the next year.

For example:

- A teammate cannot reallocate the budget from a company-wide event to an individual trip.
- A teammate cannot use their team budget for individual travel.
- A teammate cannot skip the winter holiday party to get a longer stay at the spring/summer company-wide event.

There are four types of company-sponsored, company-paid travel.

## Company-wide events

Sourcegraph generally holds two company-wide events each year, each fully covered by the company:

- Winter party (typically in San Francisco)
- Spring/summer event

## Team events

- Each team is allocated $4,000 USD per year per teammate for team meetups (minimum two members of the team).
- This is designed to allow each team to hold at least one event every six months (in addition to the company-wide events above).
- This budget can be used for travel (airfare, trains, etc.), lodging (hotels, rental homes, etc.), events, meals and entertainment, and more.
- Teams are expected to use discretion about what events are appropriate for team outings. Be inclusive! Contact @sourcegraph/people-ops with any questions.
- Reserve plenty of time for just hanging out, touring around, having fun, etc. Quality time is important.
- If one individual is a member of multiple teams, they will receive the same amount for each of their teams.
- The budget can be used for online team bonding events if the team prefers.

## Individual travel

- Each teammate has one fully-paid trip per year to meet up with a group of teammates in another location.
  - This is *in addition* to the other benefits mentioned on this page.
  - The purpose of defining this as one “trip” (instead of providing a set dollar budget) is to avoid punishing teammates that live far away from other teammates, and who would therefore incur higher airfare costs.


## Professional development and education

- Each team member has a $1,000 USD budget for professional development and education, as outlined on our [benefits page](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/people-ops/benefits-and-perks#professional-development).
- This can also be used for travel related to professional development (e.g., for conferences or training sessions).
