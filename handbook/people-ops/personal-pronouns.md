# Personal pronouns

To help make everyone feel welcome at Sourcegraph, we ask everyone to use people’s personal pronouns. For our colleagues, these are listed on [our team page](https://about.sourcegraph.com/company/team) next to each person’s name.

Pronouns differ for everyone, and referring to someone with an incorrect pronoun can be harmful. You can privately ask “What pronouns do you use?” or “How should I refer to you?”, and you can fall back to “they/them/their” if you are unsure.

Some may choose to use singular “they” pronouns, eg:

- "X would probably love these extra adorable pictures I took of my cat today, I should send them some!""
- "X deleted all the databases and their backups!? How did they even do that?
- "I should ask X to make me a playlist, their music is always so groovy!""

Other [enby](https://www.dictionary.com/e/gender-sexuality/enby/) pronouns include: ze/hir, co/cos, xe/xem/xyr, hy/hym/hys, or no pronoun and using that person’s name instead.

Here are some things that colleagues do to help make others feel comfortable sharing their pronouns:

- Including pronouns in your email signature and on various profiles (Slack, LinkedIn, Twitter)
- Mentioning your pronoun when introducing yourself to a new colleague

_Please note that we are not allowed to ask for pronouns during the interview process for legal reasons. We encourage hiring managers, interviewers, and others to use the default “they/them/their” during the interview process. You may also choose to offer your pronouns when introducing yourself to interviewees, which can give the interviewee an opportunity to share theirs._


## What if you make a mistake?

- Quickly correcting yourself is more likely to make the misgendered person comfortable than doing something that requires spending more time on it.
- You can gently correct others when they make a mistake.
    - e.g. : \
Person A: “in our last meeting, he said -”  \
Person B: “they said” \
Person A: “thanks, they said their cat actually wrote most of the PR”
- If there is no opportunity to correct someone in real time without being disruptive, a private follow-up later is also helpful.


## Additional resources

If you have any questions about this or how to support other queer folks in your life, you can ask for help in the #DEI channel on Slack or privately message Garo (@garo) on Slack.
