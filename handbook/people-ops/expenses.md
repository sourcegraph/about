# Submitting expenses

## Submit expenses every month

Teammates should submit expenses at the end of every month, ideally in a single report for the full month.

Our accountants prepare unaudited financial statements every month based on the prior month's spending. Submitting expenses soon after the month ends simplifies their jobs, makes the financial reports we rely on for planning more accurate, helps @dan track and ensure that each teammate is in compliance with our monthly expense limits, and helps you get your money back faster!

Any expenses more than 90 days old require approval by @dan.

## Contractors

Contractors should also submit expense reports promptly at the end of each month, and include the expenses in their monthly invoices. Once the expenses are approved, the full invoice can be paid.

## Systems

We use Expensify for expense report submission and approval. You will receive an invitation to our Expensify organization during onboarding.

### Expense categories

Please ensure that each expense is properly categorized. Some frequently asked questions about categories include:

- Software purchases or subscriptions should be categorized as "Software and SaaS <$1000"
- Wellness/gym reimbursements should be categorized as "Fringe benefits"
