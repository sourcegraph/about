# VP People Operations

Sourcegraph builds universal code search for every developer and company so they can innovate
faster. We help developers and companies with billions of lines of code create the software you
use every day.

To achieve this mission, we’re looking for a VP People Operations to help support and grow our

for and invested in from their first moments of on-boarding (of highest priority right now) all the
way through to their multi-year anniversary and everything in between. You will create a holistic
strategy in a fully remote setting and build out the infrastructure that will help us not only scale
but continue to invest in and develop the amazing talent that we’re so fortunate to work
alongside. While our teammates are hyper-focused on our customers, we need you
hyper-focused on them. You’ll ensure that our values are embedded into and applied to all of the
work we do.
