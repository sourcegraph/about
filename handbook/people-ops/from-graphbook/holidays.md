# Holidays

We have a team that is based throughout many parts of the world and we respect everyone's local holidays. Therefore, there is no need for teammates to provide a specific enumeration of holidays by country, as holidays are explicitly covered as part of our unlimited PTO policy. 

Teammates should add their respective holidays to the "Not working" calendar as far in advance as possible in order to communicate to the team that they will be unavailable for those particular dates. 

There are a few holidays that many teammates will typically observe and for those dates we will reschedule any Monday team meetings over to the following Tuesday. Those holidays include:

* New Years Day - observed January 1st

* Martin Luther King Jr. Day - observed 3rd Monday in January

* Fourth of July - observed July 4th

* Christmas Eve and Christmas - observed December 24th and 25th
