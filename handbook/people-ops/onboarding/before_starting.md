# Before starting (onboarding preparation)

This is a breakdown of what new teammates (and hiring managers) can expect People Ops to do to help them prepare for their first day at Sourcegraph. 

## Future improvements

It’s important to note that today’s onboarding procedures were created and built for a much smaller volume of people than we are currently onboarding. This page will outline the steps we are currently taking for each weekly cohort, but please keep in mind that many of these procedures and tools will be changing as our first Onboarding and Training Manager starts. 

Recent and planned improvements are noted in _italics_ in the list below.

## People Ops onboarding

### Immediately after offer signing

- Each new teammate is added to [teammate tracking spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qt3rGNRVaSyi_N2uN3DaXvlg8LjfKLJb8PFfrQsmR-I/edit#gid=948830545) (name, title, start date, location)

### One week prior to first day

- Each new teammate receives a welcome email a week before their start date providing information and asking questions about benefits, email address selection, equipment purchases, and other onboarding logistics (we provide two templates, for US and non-US teammates)
  - [US template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a3uhkt0bvmMuTmFBvroEXSdQGIPwCz8BLgk_YiSMZUQ/edit)
  - [Non-US template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OxrGknE6NKoeMY7qMDe5th8ZL3juxFOKfH-eywWuwko/edit)
  - _As of 2021-01-18, all hiring managers are CCed on these emails_
  - _Our goal is to do these further in advance of one week before starting as the People Ops team grows_
- Each new teammate's personalized onboarding checklist is created by the Friday before their start date (we provide two onboarding checklists, for US and non-US teammates)
  - [US template - Google Tables](https://tables.area120.google.com/u/0/workspace/ahgZbSufPWldLJBbYNYk9F?utm_source=share&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=workspacelink)
  - [Non-US - Asana](https://app.asana.com/-/login?u=%2F0%2F1199579360338646%2F1199579360338646)
  - _One of our first onboarding issues to tackle in the coming weeks is getting onboarding checklists into a more cohesive state that bundles general onboarding + team/role specific onboarding, and does it in one place vs. a combination of tools + handbook_
    - _Google Tables’ layout and model is more ideal, but it is in beta and only available in the US right now, so we will continue to use Asana for non-US teammates until this issue is resolved_
- Each new teammate is added to a short list of general onboarding accounts
  - Gmail + any specific mailing groups
    - _As of 2021-01-15, all hiring managers will be notified of the email addresses going live upon creation_
  - Slack + any specific channels and/or teams
  - GitHub (if they already have an account)
  - 1Password
  - Zoom
  - Lever
  - Lattice
- Each new teammate is assigned an onboarding buddy by their manager (People Ops will reach out to managers via Slack to confirm the onboarding buddy)

### The week of onboarding

- Each new teammate is added to additional necessary accounts/tools via the [#it-tech-ops channel in Slack](../../ops/tech-ops/index.md)
  - This list of accounts is genererated based on the information submitted by managers in the [Tools for new teammates](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1jomAli8M6Gy4kAjIN_xrIy0_Snc_jhmREM68lRDIhc8/edit) Google Form
  - People Ops sends out a summary of new teammates and the accounts they need to be added to in #it-tech-ops ([recent example](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C01CSS3TC75/p1610390093228100))
