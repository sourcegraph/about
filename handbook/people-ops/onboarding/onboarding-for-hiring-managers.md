\f0\fs24 \cf0 # Onboarding process for Hiring Managers\
\
As the company grows, new hires are joining almost every week. The onboarding process the new hire goes through requires actions from both PeopleOps and the Hiring Manager. Some Hiring Managers are doing this for the first time and they don\'92t know what the process looks like, here they will find the necessary information. \
\
\
<table>\
  <tr>\
   <td><strong>Before first day</strong>\
   </td>\
   <td>\
   </td>\
  </tr>\
  <tr>\
   <td>About ten days before the new hire starts (or as soon as they sign the contract, if they haven\'92t by that time) a Welcome email is sent to the new hire with the Hiring Manager in CC. Here we ask for certain information we need to get them onboarded:\
<p>\
\
    We confirm start date\
<p>\
\
    We confirm email preference\
<p>\
\
    We send out information about purchasing the laptop\
<p>\
\
    We ask for T-shirt size, for swag purposes, and address for shipping\
<p>\
\
    We ask for a selfie\
<p>\
\
    For US hires we inform about documentation needed for I-9 paperwork\
<p>\
\
    We ask for their phone number, for account setup\
<p>\
\
    And GitHub username, if they have one.\
   </td>\
   <td>PeopleOps\
   </td>\
  </tr>\
  <tr>\
   <td>About a week before the first day, the Hiring Manager needs to fill out this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQjfoLjAZUim7pVYw9joQCssXuVz2t2RlpjLadzmHrj15cwQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">Google Form</a> with all the relevant tools, channels and groups the new hire needs to be added to be able to start on day one. Also, here is where the preferred Onboarding buddy is suggested.\
   </td>\
   <td>Hiring Manager\
   </td>\
  </tr>\
  <tr>\
   <td>The Thursday before they start, we create their Sourcegraph email. Once we have this we add them to:\
<p>\
\
    Slack\
<p>\
\
    Zoom\
<p>\
\
    1password\
<p>\
\
    Lever\
<p>\
\
    Lattice\
<p>\
\
    Process St.\
<p>\
And create a Check in meeting for new hires with PeopleOps after the first month.\
   </td>\
   <td>PeopleOps\
   </td>\
  </tr>\
  <tr>\
   <td>We will also let Hiring Managers know through the #people-ops channel in Slack that the email is live. Now you should:\
<p>\
\
    Create recurring 1:1 with new teammate\
<p>\
\
    Add new teammate to any team/role specific meetings and calls\
<p>\
Having this done before day one will make it easier for the new hire and an overall better experience.\

   </td>\

  <tr>\
   <td>PeopleOps will contact the suggested buddy and make sure they are available. Once they accept, we\'92ll create a weekly recurring meeting for both of them to meet for a month.\

   <td>PeopleOps\
   </td>\
  </tr>\
  <tr>\
   <td>The Friday before they start, we will send an email. Here they will have the login details to start on their first day, the link to their Process St checklist and useful information (Onboarding buddy program, the Monday\'92s company meeting where they will be introduced, we are handbook first, etc.).\
