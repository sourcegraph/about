# Onboarding

Welcome to Sourcegraph! We are so excited to have you on the team. This page outlines what you'll need to do to get started.

## Guiding principles

### Everyone is here to support you as you onboard

Joining a new company can be overwhelming — there's a lot to learn! As you navigate your first few weeks at Sourcegraph, we want you to know that everyone on the team is here to help and will gladly drop anything to answer any question you have.

Every time you're curious or confused about something — just ask! When you do so, use [public discussion channels](../../communication/team_chat.md#avoid_private_messages) as much as possible.

### Think and act like an owner

At Sourcegraph, we don't think of teammates as resources — we think of them as owners of their work, who constantly reevaluate how to use their talents to be as impactful as possible. We value your opinions and ideas. You should always feel empowered to identify potential improvements and act upon them, whether they be improvements to processes (like onboarding), our handbook and general documentation, our codebase and tooling, or our product.

Never assume that a problem is somebody else's to fix!

## Before you start at Sourcegraph

Hiring managers can refer to the [Before starting](before_starting.md) page.

1. One week prior to your first day, People Ops will send you a welcome email. Be sure to send them your address, ID, shirt size, and photo for your avatar.
1. Order [your computer](../spending-company-money.md#computers).
1. Order the [desk equipment](../spending-company-money.md#desk-set-up) you need to be productive working remotely.

You will be able to submit an expense reimbursement for the computer and desk equipment when you start.
