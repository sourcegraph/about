## For all new teammates

> NOTE: This list is incomplete because it includes only new steps added since the creation of the Sourcegraph handbook. Eventually all of the onboarding docs above will be migrated to this Sourcegraph handbook, then this list will be complete and this note can be removed.

- Watch the [new team member intro from the CEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVHUGZe5uts)
- [Configure Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r/settings)
  - Add your working hours to Google Calendar so your teammates know when it is safe to add meetings to your calendar.
  - Add any local [holidays](../holidays.md) you observe to your calendar so people know you're not working.
  - Make it so any attendees can edit meetings you create: `Default guest permissions: Modify event` (this makes it easy for teammates to reschedule when necessary).
- Set up a recurring weekly 25-minute [1-1 meeting](../../leadership/1-1.md) with your manager (e.g., `1-1 $YOURNAME-$MANAGERNAME`).
- If you are not familiar with Git, complete the [Git introduction](git_intro.md).
- [Create an account on GitHub.com](https://github.com/join) if you don't already have one.
- Add yourself to the [team page](../../../company/team/index.md).
- Add a link to your team page bio to your Slack profile
- Read the first page of [Sourcegraph's user documentation](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/user).
- It might not be immediately necessary, but if you ever need to click a HubSpot link just ask for access in #sales.
- Go through the [analytics onboarding](https://sourcegraph.looker.com/projects/sourcegraph_events/files/1_home.md). This onboarding is within Looker, so if you don't have an account you can ask for access in #analytics. 
- Read Sourcegraph's [information security policy](https://about.sourcegraph.com/security) and acknowledge your acceptance: https://forms.gle/LUK1YtwAMJLhtRPi6.
- Watch Dan's [Sourcegraph Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VUZ0rnZQpNgjtGDI0tMC-h-OtL0Czz8H/view)
