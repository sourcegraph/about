## Guiding principles

### Everyone is here to support you as you onboard

Joining a new company can be overwhelming — there's a lot to learn! As you navigate your first few weeks at Sourcegraph, we want you to know that everyone on the team is here to help and will gladly drop anything to answer any question you have.

Every time you're curious or confused about something — just ask! When you do so, use [public discussion channels](../../communication/team_chat.md#avoid_private_messages) as much as possible.

### Think and act like an owner

At Sourcegraph, we don't think of teammates as resources — we think of them as owners of their work, who constantly reevaluate how to use their talents to be as impactful as possible. We value your opinions and ideas. You should always feel empowered to identify potential improvements and act upon them, whether they be improvements to processes (like onboarding), our handbook and general documentation, our codebase and tooling, or our product.

Never assume that a problem is somebody else's to fix!

## For all new teammates

- Watch the [new team member intro from the CEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVHUGZe5uts)
- [Configure Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r/settings)
  - Add your working hours to Google Calendar so your teammates know when it is safe to add meetings to your calendar.
  - Add any local [holidays](../holidays.md) you observe to your calendar so people know you're not working.
  - Make it so any attendees can edit meetings you create: `Default guest permissions: Modify event` (this makes it easy for teammates to reschedule when necessary).
- Set up a recurring weekly 25-minute [1-1 meeting](../../leadership/1-1.md) with your manager (e.g., `1-1 $YOURNAME-$MANAGERNAME`).
- If you are not familiar with Git, complete the [Git introduction](git_intro.md).
- [Create an account on GitHub.com](https://github.com/join) if you don't already have one.
- Add yourself to the [team page](../../../company/team/index.md).
- Add a link to your team page bio to your Slack profile
- Read the first page of [Sourcegraph's user documentation](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/user).
- It might not be immediately necessary, but if you ever need to click a HubSpot link just ask for access in #sales.
- Go through the [analytics onboarding](https://sourcegraph.looker.com/projects/sourcegraph_events/files/1_home.md). This onboarding is within Looker, so if you don't have an account you can ask for access in #analytics.
- Read Sourcegraph's [information security policy](https://about.sourcegraph.com/security) and acknowledge your acceptance: https://forms.gle/LUK1YtwAMJLhtRPi6.
