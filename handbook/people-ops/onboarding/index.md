# Onboarding

Welcome to Sourcegraph! We are so excited to have you on the team. This page outlines what you'll need to do to get started.

For Hiring Managers, visit the [Onboarding process for Hiring Managers](onboarding-for-hiring-managers.md) page.

## Guiding principles

### Everyone is here to support you as you onboard

Joining a new company can be overwhelming — there's a lot to learn! As you navigate your first few weeks at Sourcegraph, we want you to know that everyone on the team is here to help and will gladly drop anything to answer any question you have.

Every time you're curious or confused about something — just ask! When you do so, use [public discussion channels](../../communication/team_chat.md#avoid_private_messages) as much as possible.

### Think and act like an owner

At Sourcegraph, we don't think of teammates as resources — we think of them as owners of their work, who constantly reevaluate how to use their talents to be as impactful as possible. We value your opinions and ideas. You should always feel empowered to identify potential improvements and act upon them, whether they be improvements to processes (like onboarding), our handbook and general documentation, our codebase and tooling, or our product.

Never assume that a problem is somebody else's to fix!

## Onboarding standards and success

### Onboarding expectations
This is a basic breakdown of our expectations for providing a smooth onboarding process:

- New teammate has the tools and resources they need to navigate their day to day (accounts, software...)
- New teammate has the necessary support from their peers, manager, and People team (regular 1-1s, shadowing...)
- New teammate knows where to find answers to their questions 
- New teammate experiences no logistical challenges (payroll, expenses, benefits, setting up accounts or other systems...)
- The onboarding checklist is manageable and easy to navigate by new teammate'
- New teammate has the necessary understanding of Sourcegraph's values, products, value proposition, and internal processes to be able to conduct their role responsibilities

### Onboarding experience
Surveys are conducted at the 3-month mark to collect feedback from all new teammates to make sure that their onboarding experience is properly equipping them with the support and resources necessary for them to be successful in their new role. 

#### Onboarding content
Survey questions:

- Was there anything that was not provided in your onboarding that you think should have been?
- Did the onboarding process provide you the tools to carry out your role?
- Did you have the resources to use them properly?
- Did you have the necessary check-ins with your manager and teammates to ask questions, have shadowing sessions, etc?

#### Onboarding format and presentation
Survey questions:

- Was the onboarding platform (Process.st) intuitive and easy to follow?
- Was the format easy to follow?
- Was each task and its purpose communicated clearly?

#### Mid-onboarding check-in
People Ops sets up individual meetings to collect live feedback and address any questions or concerns from every new teammate at the 1-month mark.

### Onboarding effectiveness
Surveys are also conducted at the 3-month mark to collect feedback from hiring managers to measure overall onboarding effectiveness so we can ensure that our onboarding is helping new teammates properly ramp up for their roles in the expected timeframe.

Survey questions:

- Was the teammate able to comply with their assignments (in time)?
- Were they responsive?
- Did they participate in team meetings?
- Were they able to integrate to the team?
- Have they made meaningful contributions?
- Are they able to perform expected duties for their role?

If this needs to get more specific by role, we can make adjustments to questions if needed.
