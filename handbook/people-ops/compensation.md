# Compensation

## Salary

We pay competitive salaries because we want teammates focused on helping Sourcegraph succeed, not worrying about paying their bills.

### Currency

We pay salaries in USD.

## Equity

We are an early stage technology company, and your ability to make a positive impact is huge. We want to make sure that, if we execute properly, you share in the financial success of the organization.

TODO(@sourcegraph/people-ops): add more detail here about the kind of options and how to understand their value.

## Benefits and perks

See [Benefits and perks](benefits-and-perks).

## Compensation increases

Everyone's compensation is reviewed regularly as part of our [performance review](performance-reviews.md) process.

## Benchmark

We use market data from various sources (e.g. venture capital firms, 3rd-party consultants) to determine the market rate for each role and level within that role.

To provide competitive and generous compensation (both salary and equity) to everyone, regardless of location, we target our initial offers to the 80th-percentile market rate in San Francisco, California ([one of the most expensive cities in the world](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-expensive-is-san-francisco-mind-blowing-facts-2019-5)). This means that when you start at Sourcegraph, your compensation will be higher than 80% of people who are in the same role as you at companies similar in size/stage to Sourcegraph in San Francisco.

## Ranges

TODO(@sourcegraph/people-ops): publish salary and equity ranges for each role and level.
