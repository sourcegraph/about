# Compensation

Our compensation plan includes three components: cash (salary and commissions), equity, and benefits/perks.

We use market data from various sources (e.g. venture capital firms, 3rd-party consultants) to determine the market rate for each role and level within that role.

To provide competitive and generous compensation (both cash and equity) to everyone on our [all remote team](../../company/remote/index.md) (regardless of location), our compensation is benchmarked against market rates in San Francisco, California ([one of the most expensive cities in the world](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-expensive-is-san-francisco-mind-blowing-facts-2019-5)).

## Cash (salary and commission)

We pay competitively because we want to hire the best people and we want our teammates to be focused on helping Sourcegraph succeed, not worrying about paying bills.


We pay salaries in USD.

## Equity

We are an early stage technology company, and your ability to make a positive impact is huge. We want to make sure that, if we execute properly, you share in the financial success of the organization.

TODO(@sourcegraph/people-ops): add more detail here about the kind of options and how to understand their value.

## Benefits and perks

See [Benefits and perks](benefits-and-perks.md).

## Compensation increases

Everyone's compensation is reviewed regularly as part of our [performance review](performance-reviews.md) process.


## Ranges

TODO(@sourcegraph/people-ops): document salary and equity ranges for each role and level, and document the percentile compensation we target for initial offers (see above paragraph that is commented out).
