# United States visa sponsorship policy

## Existing visas
If a candidate has an existing visa, we will accept a visa transfer from the former employer and sponsor the existing visa for the candidate so long as the visa is compatible with an all-remote work setting.


## New visas
We will agree to sponsor new visas for teammates that have worked at Sourcegraph a minimum of 12 months prior to initiating a visa petition. Any visas sponsored by Sourcegraph must be compatible with an all-remote work setting.
