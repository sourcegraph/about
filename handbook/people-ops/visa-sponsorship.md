# United States visa sponsorship policy

## Existing visas
If a candidate has an existing visa, we will accept a visa transfer from the former employer and sponsor the existing visa for the candidate so long as the visa is compatible with an all-remote work setting.


## New visas
We will agree to sponsor new visas assuming the visa being applied for is compatible with an all-remote work setting and if the candidate is willing to stay on and work from a non-U.S. country if the visa is unable to be obtained.
