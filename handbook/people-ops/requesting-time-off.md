# Requesting time off

The process outlined below is today's process, but please be aware that the People Ops team is actively working on implementing a new one that will provide a platform for requesting time off via HRIS. 

Current expectations for requesting time off:

- Notify your manager with as much notice as possible, via the channel you regularly use to communicate other important information (e.g. email, Slack, 1-1)
- Once approved by your manager, create a calendar event (on your own calendar) like the one outlined on this [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BIq-4fZmLHYiX7z-pLfeLqmLiP9z5cX9hy851H-D2Js/edit?usp=sharing)
- Before heading out, make sure you [update your Slack status](https://slack.com/help/articles/201864558-Set-your-Slack-status-and-availability) to reflect that you are unavailable (you can adjust your notification settings as part of this as well)

**Please note:** The "Not working" calendar is now phased out, any existing entries on that calendar should be replaced by the above process until the new HRIS process is implemented.
