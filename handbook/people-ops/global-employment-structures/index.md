# Our global employment structures
Being an all-remote company without entities outside of the US yet, we adopt different ways of engaging talent across the world. Here we outline the different ways we do this outside of the US, and the considerations and limitations associated with each type, for hiring managers and referring teammates to be aware of. 

## Full-time contractors (non-US teammates)
Our preferred method for engaging the work of teammates outside of the US is as a full-time contractor. 

### Contracts
Full-time contracting teammates receive a contracting agreement specific to the country they are based in. (In some instances, they may receive a more generic “international” contract if one is not available for their specific country). This contracting agreement will specify a start date but may be open-ended. 

### Benefits, allowances and expenses
Full-time contracting teammates are not eligible for benefits. We wanted to give teammates the flexibility to work from anywhere in the world, and a contracting structure allowed us to offer that. We chose to keep all offers and roles on a U.S. salary, rather than adjusting for cost of living by location. The intention is that this difference would allow teammates to cover the benefits we are unable to provide on a contracting structure. 
Full-time contracting teammates can expense recurring expenses as outlined in our handbook.

### Payments
Full-time contracting teammates are paid via invoice on a monthly basis, in their local currency, through Veem. They are required to submit an invoice at the end of each month with their monthly salary rate, expensed perks, and any expensed materials (e.g. computer, desk, etc.).

Teammates may also choose to incorporate and create an entity through which to bill their services through if there are tax benefits they’d choose to take advantage of in their country. Sourcegraph cannot provide personal financial or tax advice and encourages all teammates to speak to their own advisors.

### Onboarding
Full-time contracting teammates are marked as hired in Greenhouse, have a start date that aligns with the cohort calendar, have a profile in Bamboo, and enjoy the same thorough general or team-specific onboarding enjoyed by regular teammates. 

## Full-time employees (non-US, via EOR/PEO)
In exceptional cases where a candidate outside of the US cannot join as a full-time contractor, we may decide to engage a Professional Employment Organization (PEO) or Employer of Record (EOR) as a third party employer. 
We are currently assessing the viability of using PEOs and EORs on a country-by-country basis, based on multiple factors (the number of teammates in the country, the availability of a partner PEO, local legal requirements, costs and more). Until we have done the due diligence here, a full-time contracting agreement remains the preferred method for securing talent outside of the US. 

The Talent team and hiring managers carefully assess these exceptional cases where a PEO/EOR may be required, and engage the PeopleOps team to chat about the merit of the case early on, as our current partner, Remote, may not be able to support us in all countries.

### Contracts
Teammates who are employed via Employer of Record (EOR) or Professional Employment Organization (PEO) will receive an employment agreement directly from the EOR/PEO (our current preferred partner is Remote). The EOR/PEO will act as the direct employer as they are incorporated in the particular country where we are hiring the teammate.

### Benefits, allowances and expenses
Teammates employed via EOR/PEO have reasonable access to benefits and allowances either via company- required contributions, or expense claims. Additional benefits may be offered in certain countries where they are legislated and therefore available through the EOR/PEO. 

### Payments
Teammates employed via EOR/PEO will be paid on a monthly basis via direct deposit, in their local currency through the EOR/PEO. Expenses are logged via the EOR/PEO’s platform and will be paid out along with their monthly salary. 

### Onboarding
Full-time employees via PEO/EOR are marked as hired in Greenhouse, have a start date that aligns with the cohort calendar, have a profile in Bamboo, and enjoy the same thorough general or team-specific onboarding enjoyed by regular teammates. 

## Temporary Contractors
As we’re building a company for the long-term, we rarely take on temporary contractors in any country (including the US) unless under exceptional circumstances, like once-off projects or to cover for an existing teammate who will be away for a short period of time.  Temporary contractors are independent contractors who supply work or services to us on an “as needed” basis, use their own systems and tools to do so, and invoice us monthly for the work they’ve done. While we strive to make them feel welcome and support their success in their short time with us, they are not considered teammates, and some of their access to our systems, meetings and benefits may be limited. 

### Contracts
Temporary contractors receive a generic temporary contract that specifies a contracting fee, a start date and an expiry date, and dates are only extended if agreed in writing, no more than one (1) month before the contract expires. 

### Benefits, allowances and expenses
Due to their classification as temporary contractors, they are not eligible for benefits and allowances as per our handbook, and we are unable to reimburse any expenses related to these. Costs incurred in performing the duties of the role may be considered. 

### Payments
Temporary contractors are paid via invoice on a monthly basis, in their local currency, through Veem or Bill.com. They are required to submit an invoice at the end of each month with the work completed as agreed in their temporary contractor agreement. 

### Onboarding
Temporary contractors are marked as hired in Greenhouse, have a start date that aligns with the cohort calendar, and have a temporary profile in Bamboo, but typically they do not gain access to the thorough general or team-specific onboarding enjoyed by regular teammates. Their onboarding usually includes a welcome email with information for their first day, and the onboarding checklist and resources, but excludes activities like being introduced in the company meeting, meet & greets, lunch & learns, buddies and feedback milestones. Access to Slack is also limited to “multi-channel guests” and specific channels requested by the hiring manager. 

Hiring managers should consult the Talent and PeopleOps team early if an exceptional situation requires a different onboarding process for reasons critical to the role, or if the role is expected to become a full-time role in the near future. Alternatively, it’s up to hiring managers to set up introductions and provide information as needed for the purpose of the temporary contract.

## Work Visas
Our decision to go fully remote was done in consideration to being able to engage talented people all over the world, without being limited to those who lived in a particular country or those who were able to acquire visas to work in a particular country. Our teammates can work from anywhere in the world, so we’ve limited sponsorship for visas to only roles that would actively require the presence in a particular country as part of their role and job responsibilities at Sourcegraph. In such cases we will work to support teammates as much as possible, but if we do not currently work with a PEO/EOR that can sponsor the visa in the country, there may be a significant delay (multiple months) as we investigate and implement an alternative solution. We encourage hiring managers to let us know as early as possible, before the role is even opened, if such requirements exist.

If a candidate is currently on a visa and would prefer to keep their status in a particular country for personal reasons, Sourcegraph may be able to take on the sponsorship (depending on our EOR/PEO’s ability to support/sponsor the specific visa; see the full list of countries in which we currently offer PEO-based employment at <LINK>.), but we may require the teammate to carry the cost of transferring the visa to the PEO/EOR involved.
