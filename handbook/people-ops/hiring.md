# Hiring

## Tools

The source-of-truth for our open positions is [our careers repository](https://github.com/sourcegraph/careers).

We use [Google Hire](https://hire.withgoogle.com/t/sourcegraphcom/hiring/landing/active) for our applicant tracking system (ATS). Google Hire is [being discontinued September 1, 2020](https://support.google.com/hire/answer/9460306) so we are in the process of evaluating alternatives.

## Values and practices

1. We want our hiring process to access all potential qualified candidates.
   - We proactively promote our open positions to many different groups, communities, and networks.
2. We want our hiring process to be fair to all candidates.
   - Our job descriptions use inclusive language.
   - We ask a consistent set of questions to each candidate so that we can objectively measure performance across candidates.
   - There are two interviewers in each interview so that we can better detect and compensate for misunderstandings during the interview and biases in the written feedback after the interview.
   - Interviewers take written notes during the interview so there is an objective record of the interview that can be referenced when making a hiring decision.
   - All interviewers submit written feedback independently before being able to see feedback from other interviewers.
   - We maintain a consistent hiring [decision process](#decision-making-process) for all candidates.

## Decision making process

We review each candidate at each stage of our hiring pipeline (e.g. application, phone screen, interviews, references) to determine if we want to move the candidate to the next stage. Here some things that we consider:

- Applications
    - Does this candidate meet all qualifications for the role they are applying for?
    - Does this candidate's resume and application effectively communicate their skills, accomplishments, and a genuine interest in Sourcegraph?
    - How does this candidate compare to other candidate's in our pipeline and our current team?
- Interviews
    - Does this candidate have the skills and experience that we are looking for?
    - How does this candidate compare to other candidate's in our pipeline and our current team?
    - What makes us excited about hiring this candidate?
    - Is this candidate in the top N candidates for the role (where N is the number of hires we want to make)?

## Sharing interview feedback

We don't share specific reasons or feedback if we decide not to move forward in our hiring process with a candidate.

It would be nice if we could give feedback like this, but we don't do this today. Why?

- The written feedback that we collect during our interview process is intended for an internal audience. We don't ask our interviewers to spend time and effort packaging their feedback in a way that can be delivered directly to candidates.
- Adequately summarizing all interview feedback for a candidate is challenging and time consuming. We choose to spend our time focusing on delivering developmental feedback to our existing teammates.

## Respecting time

Interviewing requires time and effort, both for us and for candidates. If we determine that we won't be moving forward in our hiring process before a candidate has completed all interviews, then we will cancel the remaining interviews to be respectful of both the candidate's and interviewers' time.
