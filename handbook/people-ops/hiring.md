# Hiring

## Tools

The source-of-truth for our open positions is [our careers repository](https://github.com/sourcegraph/careers).

We use [Google Hire](https://hire.withgoogle.com/t/sourcegraphcom/hiring/landing/active) for our applicant tracking system (ATS). Google Hire is [being discontinued September 1, 2020](https://support.google.com/hire/answer/9460306) so we are in the process of evaluating alternatives.

## Values and practices

1. We want our hiring process to access all potential qualified candidates.
   - We proactively promote our open positions to many different groups, communities, and networks.
2. We want our hiring process to be fair to all candidates.
   - Our job descriptions use inclusive language.
   - We ask a consistent set of questions to each candidate so that we can objectively measure performance across candidates.
   - There are two interviewers in each interview so that we can better detect and compensate for misunderstandings during the interview and biases in the written feedback after the interview.
   - Interviewers take written notes during the interview so there is an objective record of the interview that can be referenced when making a hiring decision.
   - All interviewers submit written feedback independently before being able to see feedback from other interviewers.
   - We maintain a consistent hiring decision process for all candidates.

## Sharing feedback

We don't share specific reasons or feedback if we decide not to move forward in our hiring process with a candidate.

We can only interview and hire a finite number of people in a given amount of time, so we move forward with only a few of the best candidates at each stage of our hiring pipeline.

Ultimately, each hiring decision is a complex one based on many inputs.

## Respecting time

Interviewing requires time and effort, both for us and for candidates. If we determine that we won't be moving forward in our hiring process before a candidate has completed all interviews, then we will cancel the remaining interviews to be respectful of the candidate's time.
