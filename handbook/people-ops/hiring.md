# Hiring

## Values and practices

1. We want our hiring process to access all potential qualified candidates.
   - We proactively promote our open positions to many different groups, communities, and networks.
   - If we believe there is a talented set of individuals who are not applying to our team, we will initiate outbound efforts to reach them. We believe there is value in reaching out to candidates who are not directly connected to the social graph of our team today.
2. We want our hiring process to be fair to all candidates.
   - Our job descriptions use inclusive language.
   - We ask a consistent set of questions to each candidate so that we can objectively measure performance across candidates.
   - There are two interviewers in each interview so that we can better detect and compensate for misunderstandings during the interview and biases in the written feedback after the interview.
   - Interviewers take written notes during the interview so there is an objective record of the interview that can be referenced when making a hiring decision.
   - All interviewers submit written feedback independently before being able to see feedback from other interviewers. Feedback may not be edited after submission.
   - We maintain a consistent hiring [decision process](#decision-making-process) for all candidates.

## Job descriptions

Each job description lists qualifications (requirements) and nice-to-haves. If you are unsure if you meet our qualifications, please apply.

We prefer to avoid listing "years of experience" as a qualification because time is only an indirect measure of what we really care about: skills and maturity.

Our team contains highly motivated and productive members who've joined immediately after high school/university or after 10+ years of working at some of the best companies.

## Decision making process

We review each candidate at each stage of our hiring pipeline (e.g. application, phone screen, interviews, references) to determine if we want to move the candidate to the next stage. Here are some things that we consider:

- Applications
    - Does this candidate meet all qualifications for the role they are applying for?
    - Does this candidate's resume and application effectively communicate their skills, accomplishments, and a genuine interest in Sourcegraph?
    - How do this candidate's skills, accomplishments, and interest in Sourcegraph compare to other candidates or our current team?
    - What makes this candidate's application stand out and excite us about moving forward with interviews?
- Interviews
    - Does this candidate have the skills and experience that we are looking for?
    - How do this candidate's skills, accomplishments, and interest in Sourcegraph compare to other candidates or our current team?
    - What makes us excited about hiring this candidate?

## Sharing interview feedback

We don't share specific reasons or feedback if we [decide](#decision-making-process) not to move forward in our hiring process with a candidate.

It would be nice if we could give feedback like this, but we don't do this today. Why?

- The written feedback that we collect during our interview process is intended for an internal audience. We don't ask our interviewers to spend time and effort packaging their feedback in a way that can be delivered directly to candidates.
- Adequately summarizing all interview feedback for a candidate is challenging and time consuming. We choose to spend our time focusing on delivering developmental feedback to our existing teammates.

If any interviewer is asked by a candidate for interview feedback, they may respond with the following message:

> I understand the desire to receive feedback from our interview process, but unfortunately we are not in a position to give it. Here is some public documentation to that effect:Â https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/people-ops/hiring#sharing-interview-feedback.

## Respecting time

Interviewing requires time and effort, both for us and for candidates. The hiring manager is responsible for monitoring feedback during the interview phase, and if it becomes obvious that we won't be moving forward with a candidate, then the hiring manager should cancel any remaining interviews to be respectful of both the candidate's and interviewers' time.
