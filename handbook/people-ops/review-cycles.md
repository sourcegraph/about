# Review cycles

## Why we do review cycles

The goal of these review cycles is to ensure that we’re providing every teammate the resources they need to continue to grow during their time at Sourcegraph, and review cycles offer a unique opportunity to give and receive valuable feedback from managers, direct reports, and peers. By having semiannual 360 reviews, we aim to give everyone the feedback necessary to help them progress in their career and meet their professional goals.

## Review cycle overview

We use [Lattice](https://lattice.com/) to conduct our 360 review cycles. It may prompt you to enter your goals. You are welcome to use this feature, but this should only be used for personal professional goals (as opposed to team or business goals, which are tracked in [our goals](../../company/goals/index.md)). You and your manager should discuss what works best to track your individual goals.

The 360 review process entails writing your own self review along with giving feedback to your manager, and some of the peers you’ve worked closest with. You will also receive feedback from your manager, as well as a few peers that you've selected to receive feedback from.

If you joined Sourcegraph within the last month, many of the questions in the review cycle wouldn't apply to you yet, so please answer those which you can, and write “N/A” where you can't.

Review cycles take place in February and August. They begin the first week of each of those months, and last for three weeks.

## 360 review cycle stages

### Peer selection (2 days)

**Everyone:** Log into https://sourcegraph.latticehq.com/. On your dashboard you will be prompted to select peers that you would like to have a review from. You should select 2-3 peers you’ve worked most closely with the last six months and would like to receive feedback from.

**Managers:** Log into https://sourcegraph.latticehq.com/. On your dashboard you will be prompted to approve or edit your direct reports' peer selections. Once you've made necessary changes (if any), and approved all selections, the cycle with continue onto the next stage.

### 360 feedback (8 days)

**Everyone:** You will log back into Lattice this time you will be prompted to write three different reviews by answering the questions in the prompt.

- Self review: you will write a review of yourself.
- Manager review: you will write a review of your manager.
- Peer reviews: you will write reviews of any peers that selected you to write feedback for them.

### Manager feedback + summaries (9 days)

**Managers:** You will be able to review all existing feedback for each of your direct reports and you will now be able to write your own review as well as an overall summary for each direct report. Once all of your reviews are submitted, you are ready to discuss and share the complete review packets with your direct reports during your one-on-ones.

Once the reviews are complete for each of your direct reports, you’ll be able to close out their review cycle individually in order to share their review packet with them during your next one-on-one.
