# How to get the most out of review cycles

This guide is a work in progress. 

At Sourcegraph, we conduct [360 degree review cycles](index.md) twice per year. The tips below provide guidance for how to get the most out of these review cycles.

* **Feedback is a gift**: When someone delivers feedback to you, they are putting themselves at risk. Unless they are your manager, they are under no obligation to give you real, helpful feedback. If they choose to do so, please treat it like a gift, even if it is difficult to hear.

* **Don't wait for review cycles to give feedback**: While we hold review cycles twice per year to give you a formal record of your development progress, feedback doesn't need to wait for them. In fact, feedback is more effective if it is given in real-time, as the context is clear and fresh to the recipient.

* **Keep notes all year**: It's easier to write reviews if you keep notes of your experiences working with someone over the course of the year. Managers should take regular notes about their direct reports (as should everyone else, about their peers and managers). This can help you remember specific instances where someone went above and beyond for your review. 

  And don't forget to keep notes of your own personal accomplishments as well. Learn more in [Julia Evans's](https://jvns.ca/) [Brag Documents](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/) blog post.

* **Provide specific examples**: Providing specific examples can help recipients understand and make feedback personal.
