# Teammate philosophy

When we extend you an offer to become a member of our team, it means we think you are fantastic. Your ultimate success at Sourcegraph will be a function of your personal agency and the environment we create as a team. We want that environment to set you up for success and enable you to thrive while realizing your professional goals and dreams.

Our mission is to enable everyone to unlock the economic value of code. For us, that means first helping those who code for a living understand the world of code in which they work. Ultimately, it means making the universe of code universally accessible to billions of people, most of whom currently cannot partake in the code economy. We believe the ability to make a living from code should be available to all, across the spectrum of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, national origin, disability status, and political preference.

We live these values within our own organization: We welcome people from a diverse set of backgrounds, and we want every teammate to grow and flourish at Sourcegraph regardless of their background. We believe that a team with a diverse set of viewpoints and experiences united by our common cause will give us the best chance of realizing our mission.

## Principles and expectations

Company culture is a product of the many actions we take every day as individuals. Creating a constructive and nurturing culture requires conscious effort on the part of each team member. As a general rule, we find the following guiding principles useful:

* Treat others the way you would like them to treat you.
* Include teammates in relevant discussions and be mindful of inadvertently creating "in-crowds" or "out-crowds".
* Be comfortable debating ideas, and keep debates focused on the topic at hand and the concrete actions that will be taken as an outcome of the discussion.
* Be forgiving in your inputs, careful and precise in your outputs.
* Exercise empathy. We all have bad days. Avoid attributing to character flaws what might better be explained by situational factors ([Fundamental Attribution Error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error)).
* Be transparent by default, subject to privacy and legal considerations.
* Avoid making prejudgments of people on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, national origin, or political preference. This holds both for "negative" and "positive" stereotypes.
* It is better to persuade than coerce.
* When representing Sourcegraph, be mindful that your words are a reflection on Sourcegraph and the many individuals that make up the team.
* Those in management roles should be especially mindful of their personal beliefs and biases when acting on behalf of the company.
* Be inclusive of different viewpoints, cultures, belief systems, and backgrounds.
* Appreciate individual uniqueness and do not treat individual opinions as representative of the opinion of all individuals in the same group. There is typically far greater variation within a group of individuals than between the average of different groups.
* Engage others to ensure their voices are heard. Constructive dissent should be addressed directly.
* Public polls and private ballots often do not yield the same result. Keep this in mind when gauging consensus.
* Praise in front of groups. Criticize constructively 1-on-1.
* Handle interpersonal conflict with professionalism and integrity, If there is strong disagreement, feedback should be given directly and clearly.
* You will work with others who have personal opinions or beliefs that differ from your own. Strive to overcome these differences to find common cause.
* There are often exceptions to the rule. Use your best judgment in all situations.

## Recruiting

Our recruiting pipeline consists of both inbound and outbound candidates. If we believe there is a talented set of individuals who are not applying to our team, we will initiate outbound efforts to reach them. We believe there is value in reaching out to candidates who are not directly connected to the social graph of our team today.

## Onboarding

Every new hire is paired with an "onboarding buddy" teammate who has been with the team for some time. This buddy is there to help support the new teammate as they come up to speed. In addition, we believe that helping a new hire integrate into the team is the highest priority for the team.

See the page on [onboarding](onboarding.md) for further details.
