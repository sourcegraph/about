# Donations

If you are an employee based in the United States, you can set up recurring contributions to charity organizations through [Gusto](https://manage.gusto.com/giving). This makes applying tax credits each year simple as the W-2 form sent by Gusto will include your total charitable donations (Box 14 -- Other).

Charitable contributions can be made as a one-time or a recurring (per paycheck) donation. In order to set up a contribution, select _Giving_ from the Gusto sidebar.

Then, select _Choose a charity_ and _Search for charity_ to open a dialog box.

It is recommended to search for a charity through [Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org) to find its federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). For example, the ACLU page can be found [here](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=3247).

*Not all charities are created equal*. In order to provide the most benefit for your donation, you should research how your chosen charity uses its funds, hopefully from multiple unbiased sources. Websites such as [Charity Watch](https://www.charitywatch.org/top-rated-charities) provide ratings of individual charities based on financial reporting factors such as overhead cost and amount spent to raise contributions.

As a cautionary example, the BLM Foundation page can be found [here](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.profile&ein=474143254), but is [not affiliated](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/black-lives-matter-foundation-unrelated-blm-donations) with the Black Lives Matter movement (the correct charity is the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation).
