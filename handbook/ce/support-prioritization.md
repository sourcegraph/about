# Support Prioritization

We have many factors to consider in order to determine priorities and as such, we need very clear boundaries and definitions to ensure there is only ever a single number one priority and it’s straightforward to determine what that is. 

## Priority definitions
All work is assigned a priority per these definitions:

* **p0:** Helping engineering troubleshoot and handling communications (to internal stakeholders, to customers via a status page, and to customers if they reach out) during a system outage (`about`, `/search`, or `docs` is fully unreachable) per our [p0 incident response](p0-Incident-Response.md) practice. These are rare, and when they happen, we engage ASAP and it's our most important priority until the issue is resolved.
* **p1:** All customer reported issues per our contractual p1 service level agreement definition [here](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/ce/support#our-service-level-agreements-slas).
* **p2:** All customer reported issues per our contractual p2 service level agreement definition [here](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/ce/support#our-service-level-agreements-slas).
* **p3:** Any internally identified goals/tasks/projects.

## Time allocations
80% of our time is spent on p0, p1, and p2 work (with p0 work being very rare). 20% of our time is spent on internally identified goals/tasks/projects. We protect this time with our focus blocks as outlined in our [team schedule](support-schedule.md).

## Priority assignment
Priority is always assigned by us, sometimes with input from the customer and/or other internal teams/practices/contractual obligations. We will only expect engineering to drop everything for p0. With p1, it’s okay if engineering waits a day and that can be assessed. Either way, the idea is that we expect very few p0/p1 issues overall, so the need to drop everything should be rare. This also means that it’s okay for p2 issues to sit a bit before engineering takes a look and decides timing for work. The onus will be on support to provide all the necessary context for engineering to decide how to handle p2 issues.
