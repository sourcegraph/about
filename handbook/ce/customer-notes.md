# CE customer meeting notes
Our long term goal is to ensure all customer notes are available in our CRM/Customer Success portals (which will be in sync with each other). For now, as a stop gap until all team members have the right access, etc., we will follow the below process. 

## Running meeting notes format
- NameOfClient Notes (title)
- Date of meeting (always have the latest meeting up top, so push the older meetings down when creating a new meeting)
- Attendees:
- Next Steps: 
- Notes:

## Storing customer meeting notes
- If it doesn't already exist, create a folder in the [Customer Notes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gjXWQ1l0Fnt2pVS2ohx3w0cw-gaJ_Ez0)
- Naming convention for folder: "Customer/Prospect Name", then # customer or # prospect (see folder for examples)
- Within that folder, there should be **one** main Google Doc that stores all notes (this is where the Sales, Product, Engineering, and any other team or teammembers who speak to clients add their notes to). 
  - If there are old notes/documents pertaining to this client floating around, please add them to this folder for references, and append "OLD NOTES - " to the title so it's clear for everyone what is current.
