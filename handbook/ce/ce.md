# Customer Engineers

## Our ethos

Customer Engineers at Sourcegraph are a combination of pre-sales sales engineering and post-sales customer success. We are first and foremost responsible for building and fostering relationships with developer users and champions at our prospects and customers. We serve as the technical experts during the sales cycle and help enable our customers throughout our journey together.

We show up for our customers, open source users, and teammates by living up to our Sourcegraph values and handbook, as well as in the following ways:

- We deeply know and understand our customers and their needs; we enable them and guide them
- We teach our customers new and better ways to get value from Sourcegraph as thought leaders and evangelists
- We serve as the voice of the customer to internal teams, providing key insights and feedback, and raising feature requests


## How we intersect with other teams
We work alongside just about every team at Sourcegraph. Here is how we add value to each other and a collaboration overview for each pairing.

### Sales
- **How CE adds value to sales:** CEs are the right-hand team for Sales by serving as technical experts; CEs lead product demos, guide customers through trials/POCs, lead production deployments, focuses on product usage and adoption.
- **How sales adds value to CE:** Sales, with their focus on the commercial relationship, introduces CEs to the customer relationship and helps CEs nurture the relationship.
- **Collaboration overview:** Paired together on accounts throughout the customer journey.

### Customer Support Engineers (CSEs)
- **How CE adds value to CSE:** CE has nuanced context that is valuable to how support works with a customer; CE can also help clarify / remind customers we need information (during regularly scheduled calls) on the more tricky issues.
- **How CSE adds value to CE:** Support is the go-to technical team for our CEs. CSEs resolve issues for customers both pre- and post-sales, allowing CEs to do more proactive work by taking on the reactive technical troubleshooting work when customers experience issues.
- **Collaboration overview:** CEs (or others -- including customers -- but primarily CEs) may engage support at any point during the pre-sales and post-sales customer engagement process. If the CE is stuck, doesnâ€™t know the answer, that is the exact right time to bring in support and let support do the heads-down troubleshooting work.

### Software Engineers (SWEs)
- **How CE adds value to SWEs:** CE provides important insights from prospective and current customers which inform and serve as important inputs to SWE roadmap.
- **How SWEs adds value to CE:** SWEs create a high quality product and when needed, helps educate CEs on how certain features work so that they can educate customers. SWEs also conduct via planned training sessions, periodic pairing, deep-dives on new features/products, etc.
- **Collaboration overview:** CEs can pose how-to questions and provide feedback via Slack

### Product
- **How CE adds value to product:** CEs provide a data-driven view into customer concerns/questions, ad-hoc feedback shared whilst helping customers, and helps update documentation so customers (and we) have a single source of truth.
- **How product adds value to CE:** Product educates CE on new features and helps clarify expected behavior questions.
- **Collaboration overview:** CEs provide Product with feedback and feature requests; Product seeks inputs from customer through CEs.

### Marketing
- **How CE adds value to marketing:** CEs help ensure that when developers think of Sourcegraph, they associate it with quality and responsiveness.
- **How marketing adds value to CE:** Marketing provides self-service avenues for our customers to learn and help each other learn (community, developer education).
- **Collaboration overview:** Marketing will seek customer input (surveys, feedback, case studies, etc) via CEs
