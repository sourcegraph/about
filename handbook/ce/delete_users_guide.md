# Deleting Users from Sourcegraph.com
Sometimes a user will ask us to remove their account from sourcegraph.com. This is usually requested via a support ticket to support@sourcegraph.com. 

## Deleting User Account
To delete a user account, first reply to the ticket and ask for confirmation of the username for the account they want deleted. This is to ensure that we delete the correct account. 

Once username has been confirmed, go to Sourcegraph.com > Site Admin > Users > and search for the username. 

Once the username has been found and verified, click on the red 'Nuke Account' button to confirm deletion of all user and account data associated with that username. NOTE: This action is permament and will completely delete the account. Use extreme caution with this and double and triple check that you are deleting the correct account.

Once account deletion is complete, reply back to the ticket and confirm with the user that the account has been deleted and mark the ticket as complete.
