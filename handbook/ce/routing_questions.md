# How to route questions from customers

This document is provided as a glossary for new CE team members to know how to route questions from customers. It is a rough feature ownership mapping by team.

In many cases, questions can span multiple teams. For example, a question about how to scale up indexed search to serve a large set of repositories could cover the Distribution, Cloud, and Search teams. In such cases, default to asking the [Distribution team](../engineering/distribution/index.md) for more precise guidance first.

Additions to this document are welcome.
