# Support Team Schedule

Being an [all-remote](https://about.sourcegraph.com/company/remote) company means that we can choose to work when we want. This is absolutely true for CSEs and it is also a little more complicated for us. We have to coordinate a little more so we can honor our [service level agreements (SLAs)](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/ce/support#our-service-level-agreements-slas). 

This starts by everyone on the team identifying their ideal working hours. If we have good coverage, we are set! If we have gaps, we work together to figure out a solution. 

Our schedule also makes it clear when folks on the team have dedicated heads-down focus time.

## Schedule
Our schedule is reflected in the working hours set in our calendars and blocks held on our calendar for our focus blocks.

|Team member|Local hours|Pacific hours|Focus block|Focus block
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Adeola|9:30am - 5:30pm|6:30am - 2:30pm|TBD|TBD|
|Beatrix|7am - 3pm|7am - 3pm|TBD|TBD|
|Giselle|8am - 4pm|8am - 4pm|TBD|TBD|
|Stompy|1pm - 10pm|2am - 11am|TBD|TBD|
|Warren|9am - 5pm|9am - 5pm|TBD|TBD|
|Virginia|8am - 5pm|8am - 5pm|Monday PM|Thursday PM|

Notes
* Focus blocks are listed simply as which 1/2 of which day
* Stompy would like to have as much collaboration time as possible, so he will take a 2 hour lunch and if he's feeling it, he may stay online being social until 11pm his local time. As a team, we won't schedule meetings that are best with everyone past 10pm his local time / 11am pacific.

## Adjusting the schedule
* **Ad-hoc adjustments** can be shared in the team Slack channel (#customer-support-chat).
* **Lasting adjustments** can be discussed in our weekly 1:1s. 

If an adjustment creates a gap in covering our SLAs, we will figure it out!
