# Filing customer issues

Read [the support overview](index.md) before filing an issue.

## 1. Begin to create an issue

Customer support tickets should be translated to GitHub issues. In such cases, [create a new issue for the request](https://github.com/sourcegraph/customer/issues/new).

## 2. Find the unique company URL

Find the unique company URL by [searching for the company in HubSpot](https://app.hubspot.com/contacts/2762526/companies/list/view/all/?query=).

When you filter down and find the company, click on its name to see the company's page, and copy the URL (it should contain `/company/`).

It is encouraged to add a browser search shortcut for this to make it quick and easy to find the appropriate company URL in the future. For Chrome:

1. Visit chrome://settings/searchEngines
1. Click **Add**
1. Enter:
  - **Search Engine**: HubSpot search
  - **Keyword**: `hs`
  - **URL**: https://app.hubspot.com/contacts/2762526/companies/list/view/all/?query=%s

## 3. Post the issue

Finalize the issue by providing the appropriate context and labeling with the affected companies. Once its created, sharing it with the required [team](routing_questions.md).
If necessary, link to the appropriate JIRA Service Desk ticket or HubSpot notes.
