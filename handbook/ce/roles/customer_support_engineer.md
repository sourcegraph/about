# Customer Support Engineer

Customer Support at Sourcegraph exists to resolve technical issues and answer technical/product questions in a way that feels (reasonably) effortless for our customers. Support is the go-to technical team for the Customer Engineering team, helping customers both pre- and post-sales. We show-up for our customers, open source users, and teammates by living up to our Sourcegraph [values](../../../../company/values.md) and [handbook](../../index.md), as well as these additional guiding principles:

- Seeking/providing context so the why is clear
- Demonstrating profound compassion for the people with whom our paths cross and the problems/questions we help them solve, meeting them where they are
- Only asking our customers and teammates things we can’t do or answer ourselves
- Persistently working toward and/or seeking resolution that works equally for our customers and us
- Staying at least a step ahead (summarizing current status, giving clear next steps, and setting expectations in every communication)
- Being flexible and open, maintaining a first principles thinking approach, and always confronting and growing past our biases
- Outgrowing ourselves, the way we work, and continuously improving

Keeping our reason for existence and guiding principles in mind in all of our work and interactions, we ensure consistent outcomes, allowing each member of the team to have space and creativity to get there in different ways and learn from each other.
