# Customer Engineering

On the Customer Engineering team, we help developers use Sourcegraph to solve their organization's Big Code problems. 

- [**Customer Engineers**](https://jobs.lever.co/sourcegraph/3ede0606-7a86-45d4-a627-e8cbae7a1a57) help our developer users and champions get more value from using Sourcegraph in more and better ways.
- [**Customer Support Engineers**](https://jobs.lever.co/sourcegraph/d58a382e-0c20-4dec-9657-63f164ec703a) solve technical problems from all organizations about deployment, configuration, integration, authentication, scaling, troubleshooting, and more. <!-- Example: A Customer Support Engineer might help a customer get perfect cross-repository code intelligence set up for all of their code so they have joyful and more effective code reviews. -->

We work with many other teams at Sourcegraph, including:

- with the [Sales team](../sales/index.md) in our relationships with prospects and customers; and
- with the [Product team](../product/index.md) and [Engineering team](../engineering/index.md) on product feedback and requirements (by aggregating and relaying what users tell us, and by helping team members get in touch with or solicit feedback from the right users).

## Pre-sales and post-sales

We are both "pre-sales" and "post-sales" because the moment that a sale occurs doesn't usually change what organizations need from us. Most organizations have deployed Sourcegraph and rolled it out (sometimes widely, sometimes to a limited proof-of-concept group) by the time they become a paying customer. This is different from many other enterprise software products, where the software isn't actually used (for real) until the contract is signed.

This continuity means we give customers consistent and high-quality service from the moment we meet them. We minimize handoffs, which is good for customers and helps our team take pride in seeing their work through.
