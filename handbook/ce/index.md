# Customer Engineering

The Customer Engineering team partners with the [Sales team] (../sales/index.md) from a technical and product expertise perspective to ensure that all of Sourcegraph's prospects, customers, and users get the most possible value from it. This includes showing product demos, learning and understanding prospects' internal development environment and processes, helping companies integrate Sourcegraph into their engineering stack and internal processes to maximize value to their engineering teams, helping prospects run trials to recognize Sourcegraph value firsthand, building relationships with our accounts' champions and users, communicating the value of Sourcegraph, growing engagement and owning product training and technical support, and giving as many Sourcegraph "Aha!" moments as possible.
