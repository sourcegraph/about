# Customer Engineering

On the Customer Engineering team, we help developers use Sourcegraph to solve their organization's Big Code problems.

[**Customer Engineers**](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/ce/ce) help our developer users and champions get more value from using Sourcegraph in more and better ways.

We work with many other teams at Sourcegraph, including:

- with the [Sales team](../sales/index.md) in our relationships with prospects and customers; and
- with the [Product team](../product/index.md) and [Engineering team](../engineering/index.md) on product feedback and requirements (by aggregating and relaying what users tell us, and by helping team members get in touch with or solicit feedback from the right users – see [surfacing feedback to the product team](../product/surfacing_product_feedback.md)). 
- with the [Support team](../support/index.md) who solve technical problems from all organizations about deployment, configuration, integration, authentication, scaling, troubleshooting, and more. 

### What is the difference between a Customer Engineer and Customer Support Engineer?
CSEs are the go-to technical team for our CEs, helping customers both pre- and post-sales, by taking on the reactive technical troubleshooting work when customers experience issues. We think of CE and CSE as work best friends, working closely together every day. Where Sales is focused on the commercial relationship, CE is focused on more strategically and proactively on product success/usage/adoption. If the CE is stuck, doesn’t know the answer, that is the exact right time to bring in a CSE and let support do the heads-down troubleshooting work.

The CSE team are experts on troubleshooting customer-reported issues and debugging problems with configurations, deployments, upgrades, integrations, authentication, and more.

The CE team are experts on educating customers on how to use the product (use cases and best practices) and raising feature requests to Engineering and Product on behalf of customers.

## Pre-sales and post-sales

We are both "pre-sales" and "post-sales" because the moment that a sale occurs doesn't usually change what organizations need from us. Most organizations have deployed Sourcegraph and rolled it out (sometimes widely, sometimes to a limited proof-of-concept group) by the time they become a paying customer. This is different from many other enterprise software products, where the software isn't actually used (for real) until the contract is signed.

This continuity means we give customers consistent and high-quality service from the moment we meet them. We minimize handoffs, which is good for customers and helps our team take pride in seeing their work through.
