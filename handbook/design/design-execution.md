# Design execution (DE)

*This section is a WIP, we are currently running our first [design execution document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xjygvhxjWekkhstlTch5q7x2N3L7uKMIG8Pq9IbWCaI/edit#)*

Design execution documents are where design projects live, tracking the process that was laid out in corresponding RFC's. As a company we value tracking work to make asynchronous communication easier, by having a central place for design projects to live, and by using an environment familiar to everyone at Sourcegraph, we can more easily solicit feedback.

A design execution document is a place where design is executed. Research will be organised, and discussion concerning design artifacts can take place and be documented here.

The [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12qT1U_ogBBY1ED6XlG-3MnbeOzCuYrnvoU7inpUMtPM/edit#) for design execution documents is loose, to accomodate varying design needs, and changes to process. 

All DE documents should serve 3 goals:

1. A public repository of the design process is a place to receive and solicit feedback from the team
2. Viewing the design process as a whole helps everyone understand where we are in a project, and highlights problem areas
3. Finished projects are a timeline that informs future work, and helps new team members onboard

## Overview

Design execution documents are how we track design projects, it's a place for brainstorming, research, copy, and design artifacts to live. The document is open to everyone inside the company, so you can keep up with what we're working on, and leave feedback as you see fit.

We've chosen to value documenting our progress on projects in an effort to facilitate more feedback, and to create a detailed timeline of design projects to help new additions to the team onboard faster.

Much of the information on this page is informed by our RFC template, you can read more about that here. We've done this to try and keep things consistent, and whilst design execution documents are their own thing, they will be initially informed by RFC's.

## Status

Each design execution document has a status that is in the title of the design execution document (e.g. “DE 1 ACTIVE: Title”). The editor is responsible for keeping the status updated.

| Status | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| TENTATIVE | A design problem has been identified, and an RFC is being drafted. |
| ACTIVE | The first related RFC has been approved, and the design process is underway. |
| ABANDONED | There are no plans to move forward with this design project. The initial RFC may be ABANDONED. The reason is communicated in the metadeta section of the design execution document. |
| IMPLEMENTED | This design execution document has been implemented. |

## Sequential numbering

## Items that belong in a design execution document 

- Our initial assumptions regarding research, additions, changes (brainstorm)
- Research
- Brainstorm research
- Designs (Figma links + documentation on interactions)
- Copy editing
- Project timelines

## Privacy

## Participation

Any member of the team can leave feedback on any element of a design execution document.

## Treating a design execution document post implementation

Once a project has been implemented, the editor will treat the document, keeping a private version in an archived state, and creating a new public version that removes potentially confidential information. This will be reviewed before being made public.
