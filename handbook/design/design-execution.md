# Design execution (DE)

## Planning how to use this document

Doc is for asynchronous communication regarding a design project (in this instance onboarding). Essentially this is where the design lives outside of Figma, and this file works in conjunction with figma (shares a name with the relevant figma project, figma file is the first available link)

Here’s an example of a similar document the marketing team built (category creation: universal code search): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X8OAzWmsK5MB78lKXDOBFy5dmYJ2MPsQIRw1dpTOvHc/edit#

## What will be here: 
- Our initial assumptions regarding research, additions, changes (brainstorm)
- Research
- Brainstorm research
- Designs (Figma links + documentation on interactions)
- Copy editing

## Why do we need this?:
We need a place to communicate ideas asynchronously, that is easier to access than a slack thread, and easier to comment on than github issues.

## Why is this different to an RFC?:
An RFC documents planned work, the work is executed here and in Figma. Multiple RFC’s can relate to one design execution document. This document is ongoing work and probably not a source of truth until the work is finished and implemented.
