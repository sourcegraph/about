# Product Design

The role of the product design team is to make validated decisions that enhance users experience of Sourcegraph.

Here are a few of the things we strive to make true:

- Advocate for our users by collaborating with them
- Perform our due diligence when making design decisions, by researching and testing solutions within scope
- Proactive, with a bias towards action
- Communicate openly, and solicit feedback frequently
- To be egoless when soliciting responses to our work

## How to work with design

*This section is WIP*

Advice on how to best work with the design team at Sourcegraph. 

We wanted to document this as design is new to Sourcegraph, and it might not be immediately clear how to get the most out of the design team. 

- If you're in a pinch, the design team is here to help, so don't hesitate to solicit feedback from us. Even if you think your problem might not pertain to design, don't leave it to chance
- Generally, we favour an asynchronous approach to communication, this gives us some time to validate our responses
- An example of a time to use immediate communication would be: if you're working from a design file, and you feel that something is missing
- If you feel that your GitHub issue could use input from design don't hesitate to assign one of us, or add the 'needs-design' tag
- On GitHub we have a design priorities project, so you can see what we're working on, and add anything you feel we may have missed
- If you're unsure or unfamiliar with what we're working on, check our the design drive, all of our syncs are will be documented and available
- We have a document type, the design execution document, that tracks active design projects. You can find all information about design projects here, and also contribute with feedback

## Internal Resources

Our internal resources are open, and the design team will welcome any feedback. Hesitating to leave feedback can block discussion, and stretch out time between brainstorming and action.

## How to make better UX design decisions

As the procut design team is still small and not able to address every problem efficiently, we have tried to simplify Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design. These principles are often referenced, and by referencing them yourself you can make better user experience decisions.

- Make sure the user is always appropriately informed.
- Use familiar language.
- Follow real-world conventions when ordering things.
- Make sure exits are available.
- Follow platform conventions, search online to check established UX patterns.
