# Product Design

The role of the product design team is to make validated decisions that enhance the user experience of Sourcegraph.

Here are a few of the things we strive to make true:

- Advocate for our users by collaborating with them
- Perform our due diligence when making design decisions, by researching and testing solutions within scope
- Proactive, with a bias towards action
- Communicate openly, and solicit feedback frequently
- To be egoless when soliciting responses to our work

## How to work with design

*This section is WIP*

Design is new to Sourcegraph, so we want to share how to get the most out of the design team. 

- The design team is here to help, so don't hesitate to solicit feedback from us on your work.
- Generally, we favour an asynchronous approach to communication, this gives us some time to validate our responses
- An example of a time to use immediate communication would be: if you're working from a design file, and you feel that something is missing
- If you need design help on your issue or pull request in GitHub, assign one of us or add the 'needs-design' tag.
- On GitHub we have a [design priorities project](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/66) - take a look at what we're working on, and feel free to add anything you think we may have missed.
- If you'd like more insight into what we're working on, check out [the design folder in Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xBRaw_2Ulccd_2ts0Wcq4Rgs6LuVblLU), all of our meeting notes are documented and available.
- We use [design execution documents](design-execution.md), to track active design projects. You can find all information about design projects and contribute feedback in the [design execution docs folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1z4m1wzi_UWvlMxYN5iqEv0I7MfxciE08).

## Internal Resources

Our internal resources are open, and the design team will welcome any feedback. Hesitating to leave feedback can block discussion, and stretch out time between brainstorming and action.

## How to make better UX design decisions

As the procut design team is still small and not able to address every problem efficiently, we have tried to simplify Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design. These principles are often referenced, and by referencing them yourself you can make better user experience decisions.

- Make sure the user is always appropriately informed.
- Use familiar language.
- Follow real-world conventions when ordering things.
- Make sure exits are available.
- Follow platform conventions, search online to check established UX patterns.
