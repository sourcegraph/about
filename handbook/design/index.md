# Design

As product designers at Sourcegraph our goal is to always advocate for our users. To do our due diligence by researching and testing our design solutions. To be proactive, and have a bias towards action. To be open and communicative about our work with the rest of the team. To be egoless, and excited to receive feedback and promote discussion.

## Internal Resources

Our internal resources are entirely open, and the design team is entirely welcoming of any and all feedback. Hesitating to leave feedback can block discussion, and stretch out time between brainstorming and action.

## How to make better UX design decisions

This is an attempt to simplify Jakob Nielsenâ€™s 10 general principles for interaction design, these principles are frequently referenced by designers. By referencing these principles you will be able to make better choices for our users.

- Make sure the user is always appropriately informed.
- Use familiar language.
- Follow real-world conventions when ordering things.
- Make sure exits are available.
- Follow platform conventions, search online to check established UX patterns.
