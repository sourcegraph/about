# Product Design

The role of the product design team is to make validated decisions that enhance the user experience of Sourcegraph.

Here are a few of the things we strive to make true:

- Advocate for our users by collaborating with them
- Perform our due diligence when making design decisions, by researching and testing solutions within scope
- Proactive, with a bias towards action
- Communicate openly, and solicit feedback frequently
- To be egoless when soliciting responses to our work

## Working with design

*This section is WIP*

Working with design should feel fluid, you should be able to open an issue or bring up a concern in slack, and receive actionable feedback: either implementable, or a call to explore further.

You should also not feel limited to words, images (sketches, or references made by editing the broswer DOM) are also encouraged. 

Here are the best places to talk to us:

**[Design execution documents](design-execution.md)**

- Leaving comments on any part of the document is encouraged

**Figma**

- Click 'C' whilst in Figma, or check the navigation bar in the top left hand corner and look for the comment icon; you can drop comments anywhere in a file, and the owner of the page will be notified via email

**GitHub**

- Assign one of the team, add the tag 'needs-design', and utilise the [design priorities project](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/66)

**Slack**

- Utilise the design channel
- Tag @design-team or cc one of the team

## Internal resources

Our internal resources are open, and the design team will welcome any feedback. Hesitating to leave feedback can block discussion, and stretch out time between brainstorming and action.

## How to make better UX design decisions

As the procut design team is still small and not able to address every problem efficiently, we have tried to simplify Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design. These principles are often referenced, and by referencing them yourself you can make better user experience decisions.

- Make sure the user is always appropriately informed.
- Use familiar language.
- Follow real-world conventions when ordering things.
- Make sure exits are available.
- Follow platform conventions, search online to check established UX patterns.

If you would like to dig a little deeper [here is a link to the article](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/), each section is accompanied by a short video and/or a more in depth article.
