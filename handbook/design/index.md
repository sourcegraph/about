## How to make better UX design decisions

This is an attempt to simplify Jakob Nielsenâ€™s 10 general principles for interaction design, these principles are frequently referenced by designers. By referencing these principles you will be able to make better choices for our users.

Make sure the user is always appropriately informed.
Use familiar language.
Follow real-world conventions when ordering things.
Make sure exits are available.
Follow platform conventions, search online to check established UX patterns.
