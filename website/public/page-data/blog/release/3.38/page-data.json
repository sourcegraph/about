This block lets you find any symbol in a repository, and the block will display that symbol no matter where it moves within a file.</li>\n<li>Code Intelligence is now available in Notebook blocks, making Notebooks more intuitive to be used for onboarding and learning about your codebase.</li>\n<li>Embedding Notebooks is here! You can now easily embed Notebooks from any Sourcegraph instance by embedding an iFrame anywhere, and setting <code class=\"language-text\">src</code> to <code class=\"language-text\">https://sourcegraph.com/notebooks/embed/&lt;notebook_uuid/&gt;</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Improved-Code-Intelligence-performance-for-large-repositories\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Improved-Code-Intelligence-performance-for-large-repositories\" aria-label=\"Improved Code Intelligence performance for large repositories permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Improved Code Intelligence performance for large repositories</h2>\n<p>We’re introducing a new backend service, Rockskip, for search-based Code Intelligence, the symbol sidebar, and symbol search. Rockskip was architected with monorepos in mind, and it can index new commits much faster than the existing SQLite backend.</p>\n<p>From 3.38 onwards, Rockskip can be turned on for specific repositories and it will make the symbol sidebar and search-based Code Intelligence much faster.

Now, if you have specific extensions or files that you want highlighted as a particular language, you can easily configure that in the site settings. This allows you to get accurate highlighting for custom languages, for example.</p>\n<p>To learn more and set up custom language highlight, see our <a href=\"https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/how-to/add_support_for_a_language#syntax-highlighting-support\">documentation</a>.</p>","excerpt":"Sourcegraph 3.38 is now available!
