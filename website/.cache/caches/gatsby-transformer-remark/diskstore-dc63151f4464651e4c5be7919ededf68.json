This feature surfaces high-level information about your codebase, based on both how your code changes over time and its current state. You can learn more about why we built Code Insights in <a href=\"https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/announcing-code-insights/\">the announcement from our CEO</a>.</p>\n<p>Any Sourcegraph instance can create up to two code insights, even without a trial or license.

This block lets you find any symbol in a repository, and the block will display that symbol no matter where it moves within a file.</li>\n<li>Code Intelligence is now available in Notebook blocks, making Notebooks more intuitive to be used for onboarding and learning about your codebase.</li>\n<li>Embedding Notebooks is here! You can now easily embed Notebooks from any Sourcegraph instance by embedding an iFrame anywhere, and setting <code class=\"language-text\">src</code> to <code class=\"language-text\">https://sourcegraph.com/notebooks/embed/&lt;notebook_uuid/&gt;</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Improved-Code-Intelligence-performance-for-large-repositories\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Improved-Code-Intelligence-performance-for-large-repositories\" aria-label=\"Improved Code Intelligence performance for large repositories permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Improved Code Intelligence performance for large repositories</h2>\n<p>We’re introducing a new backend service, Rockskip, for search-based Code Intelligence, the symbol sidebar, and symbol search. Rockskip was architected with monorepos in mind, and it can index new commits much faster than the existing SQLite backend.</p>\n<p>From 3.38 onwards, Rockskip can be turned on for specific repositories and it will make the symbol sidebar and search-based Code Intelligence much faster. If you’re interested in turning this on for your repositories, read more in the <a href=\"https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_intelligence/explanations/rockskip\">Rockskip docs</a> or <a href=\"mailto:support@sourcegraph.com\">contact us</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Search-your-project-dependencies-for-better-incident-resolution\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Search-your-project-dependencies-for-better-incident-resolution\" aria-label=\"Search your project dependencies for better incident resolution permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Search your project dependencies for better incident resolution</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search/how-to/dependencies_search\">Dependencies search</a> is a new beta feature that lets you search through the dependency packages of your repositories. Looking into the code of your dependencies is particularly useful when you’re trying to resolve incidents as fast as possible.</p>\n<p>Dependencies search currently supports NPM, and more dependency repositories are coming soon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Configure-custom-language-highlighting-for-files--extensions\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Configure-custom-language-highlighting-for-files--extensions\" aria-label=\"Configure custom language highlighting for files  extensions permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Configure custom language highlighting for files &#x26; extensions</h2>\n<p>In the past, it was not possible to configure what language a file was highlighted as without sending a pull request to Sourcegraph to update our global configuration for language detection. Now, if you have specific extensions or files that you want highlighted as a particular language, you can easily configure that in the site settings. This allows you to get accurate highlighting for custom languages, for example.</p>\n<p>To learn more and set up custom language highlight, see our <a href=\"https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/how-to/add_support_for_a_language#syntax-highlighting-support\">documentation</a>.</p>"}
