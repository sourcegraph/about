So, I guess, going back to an earlier part of this conversation, we were talking about CS education, programming education. Getting into it, starting with the fundamentals, that’s the spectrum. Some people are like “start with fundamentals”–that’s important, laying a solid foundation. I’m characterizing here but that’s on one end of the spectrum. The other end is like, throw the fundamentals to the wind and let’s just focus on building something cool.","position":{"start":{"line":644,"column":1,"offset":47930},"end":{"line":644,"column":472,"offset":48401},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":644,"column":1,"offset":47930},"end":{"line":644,"column":472,"offset":48401},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"strong","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Cassidy Williams:","position":{"start":{"line":646,"column":3,"offset":48405},"end":{"line":646,"column":20,"offset":48422},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":646,"column":1,"offset":48403},"end":{"line":646,"column":22,"offset":48424},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":646,"column":1,"offset":48403},"end":{"line":646,"column":22,"offset":48424},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Just build.
