So it really helps them diagnose and, and hopefully fix errors very quickly. I, I think the classic they know is, if somebody knows what Sentry is and they experienced an error in the world, they’re just like calling out the company, it’s like, “Hey, are you using Sentry?” Like, “Why aren’t you fixing your bugs?” Kind of thing.

So, you know, once upon a time … And that kind of all works and people just dealt with the fact that it wasn’t ideal.\nAnd I think a lot of the changes over the years from how we developed software, sort of forced us to think about like, “Are these tools solving problems?” And then, you know, the error monitoring, I wouldn’t call it a category, but they are monitoring functionality the way Sentry provides it, you know, which is quite drastically different than logs. That’s become more of a necessity when we’ve had a lot more front ends, so mobile browser, desktop applications that really need this rich monitoring.

And we sorta think the new wave looks so much similar to the old way, but the difference I would say now is there’s application monitoring. Don’t get that confused with APM and then there’s systems monitoring. And so systems, you can think of it as infrastructure monitoring at the end of the day. It’s easiest to say, like, “If I am running the platform layer that is, I’m building the layer that lets you ship your business logic, I need systems monitoring. I’m dealing with the servers, I have CPUs, I’ve discs, I need to rotate disc. I need to do all that stuff, right? All that makes sense. If I’m building a business layer, the business logic, and especially when you think about serverless and these kind of paradigms, I don’t care at all about that platform layer. I only care about it when you force me to care about it, which should be never at the end of the day.\nAnd so we think there’s a solution that’s needed to really focus in on that, to focus in on this idea that you don’t control the machine.

But the baseline is we give you a stack trace, which most engineers should understand, but it’s just like sort of the program instructions that were va- invalid. We do that in sort of specialized ways though, which is important. So in JavaScripts, yeah, just JavaScript code, it looks like a normal stack trace. In compiled code, it’s very different than a normal stack trace. But also, when you go to like cross language, we actually blend those together as well.

Well, often in some languages give you things like context, locals, which are basically variables that are defined during, uh, that exception, which is hugely valuable for debugging because that’s your inputs at the end of the day. And then we’ll try to give you a little bit of sort of user behavior, but PyHo, please don’t ban us again.

And so what Sentry has done, and this is an impossible problem to solve. So this will certainly not be our full forever solution, but we basically suck in a ton of events and the most abstract way. Just imagine we suck in a lot of events, some of them are errors, some of them are what we call transactions, which are a segment of a trace, uh, but it’s a request response life cycle.\nWe pipe those into the system and then we extrapolate from there. We extrapolate, is this a problem? Is it a new error? Is it a unique error? And we extrapolate, is it slow? Which is just the metric that’s accumulated from all those together, things like that. And so I’m a big believer in that model. Unfortunately, like if you just can imagine the amount of data in the world that it doesn’t scale, of course, but that’s kinda how we thought about it. So we will serve those things. I don’t know about logs. I think logs have multiple uses, but I think traces in particular are just a means to an end.

We’ve taken that and we said, the product that people need is New Relic. The data might come from tracing, but the product output looks more like New Relic. And so that’s what we’re building. There are some advanced questions you can answer by using like end-to-end traces. But for the most part, you’re a mobile developer, you’re not looking at what’s going on way down the stack in the database, right? Like, y- you have no idea what that even means, you just need to know is my mobile app performing well. And so that’s like a really important lens we put on it, but like to circle back to logging, I think that’s an interesting one because logs actually, they amount to a few things.\nOne, they’re like this duct tape solution for any problem you have. Like, if you look at elastic, they’re just like, “Put everything in a log and/or Splunk,” probably the same thing. And you can make metrics exist, and you can aggregate things together, do all these crazy stuff, which is not a super effective ","position":{"start":{"line":198,"column":671,"offset":27047},"end":{"line":200,"column":312,"offset":28409},"indent":[1,1]}},{"type":"linkReference","identifier":"00:20:00","label":"00:20:00","referenceType":"shortcut","children":[{"type":"text","value":"00:20:00","position":{"start":{"line":200,"column":313,"offset":28410},"end":{"line":200,"column":321,"offset":28418},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":200,"column":312,"offset":28409},"end":{"line":200,"column":322,"offset":28419},"indent":[]}},{"type":"text","value":" solution.

It’s not, uh, it’s not an opinion, it’s not a discussion point, that’s like a mandatory requirement for, uh, all organizations. You can’t change that, right? But then there’s also this idea of logs for debugging. And that’s really where it gets interesting because technically speaking Sentry collects logs with errors. We call them breadcrumbs, just like user click, this user click this, that’s just a log at the end of the day.\nAnd so we thought a lot about, and we frankly, will probably build it, just allowing developers to send us logs as well, because it’s very helpful in the debugging process. But I think the challenge is, and rightfully so, nobody wants to pay, you know, duplicate fees for, for all of this stuff, right? So if we’re collecting logs and they’re sending them to say Datadog, and Splunk, and all these other things, they’re not gonna be super thrilled about all the money they’re just throwing away for no reason.

It was a distributed tracing spec based on our way of thinking, which is actually quite different than what OpenTelemetry achieves. And, uh, the way I would describe that is, OpenTelemetry is about small annotations, lots and lots and lots of small annotations. Like, I read something the other day, it was on Hacker News where I think somebody on behalf of Twitter was suggesting that they had traces with a million plus spans. And that’s ludicrous to reason about like our stuff won’t even support that right now.\nAnd when I think about that, I’m like, “Okay, that probably makes it more useful, but the problem is when you think about spans, they’re very, very useful ‘cause they suggest like function call at the end of the day.” But if you try to use spans for actual profiling, like C profiling, like you’re gonna have hundreds of millions of these and it won’t work at all, like it’s too fat of a ","position":{"start":{"line":254,"column":51,"offset":42382},"end":{"line":255,"column":389,"offset":43643},"indent":[1]}},{"type":"linkReference","identifier":"00:32:00","label":"00:32:00","referenceType":"shortcut","children":[{"type":"text","value":"00:32:00","position":{"start":{"line":255,"column":390,"offset":43644},"end":{"line":255,"column":398,"offset":43652},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":255,"column":389,"offset":43643},"end":{"line":255,"column":399,"offset":43653},"indent":[]}},{"type":"text","value":" data structure.

And I think OpenTelemetry, the core concepts will stick because the core concepts have been around forever and they make a lot of sense, right? At least, the core concepts of distributed tracing and things like described in the Dapper paper, OpenTelemetry has evolved to have a bunch of other things. And I, I don’t know if I have enough, in my opinion, to say they’re good or bad, but it does feel kinda like all specs where it just gets bloated over time, and there’s a bunch stuff tacked on to please other people.

And I think, you know, when I was leaving Dropbox, I was there a little less than two years, Dropbox had grown really fast at that time. It’d become like, to me, what was a big company, it was over 1,000 employees when I left. And it was like 250 ish when I joined. And at, at that stage of the company, and for me at, at my, I’ll call it, my maturity level at the time or my professional approach at the time, like I didn’t like that kind of company. Like it wasn’t empowering for me. I didn’t feel like I could get anything done, I had to deal with a lot of politics.
