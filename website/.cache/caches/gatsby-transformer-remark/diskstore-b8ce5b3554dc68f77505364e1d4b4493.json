And we did have situations where there were code no one knew, no one wrote, no one worked on it. Whoever wrote it left.

I’ll tell you why, it’s not different. Because, well, like I started, it was code and I had to go and understand what the hell is going on there.

This is something I see a lot that some people are just… They’re go getters, they ask, they try to reach out. They’re very proactive. Some people are just they don’t ask and they don’t have the confidence. So that would be my number one tip. It’s okay not to know. It’s okay not to understand, especially when you’re just starting out. Just go and ask and look for people who can help you. And I think a lot of changed since I started.
