It was the summer of 2020 and the company was seven years old and about 50 people strong (about half of whom were engineers). In the year to come, we would grow, rapidly hiring more engineers.</p>\n<p>But scale revealed problems with the way we facilitated career growth. Before 2021, growth happened through individual conversations and high-impact work. When the engineering team numbered in the 20s, this worked. As we added engineers, however, engineering managers felt empowered to promote individual contributors (ICs) but unconfident they were calibrated with other engineering managers.</p>\n<p>Individually, engineering managers and ICs cared about career growth but the conversation around growth was unclear and at times uneven. We didn’t have a common language and without a shared understanding of growth, misunderstanding and bias would eventually be inevitable.</p>\n<p>The solution? A framework that would align the entire engineering organization and create consistent, fair, and scalalabe conversations about growth. This is the deep dive, behind the scenes story of how we collaborated to form an engineering career development framework.</p>\n<p>If you want to skip to the results, you can <a href=\"https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/engineering/career-development\">read the handbook page</a> or <a href=\"https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/software-engineer-career-ladder/#The-Sourcegraph-career-development-framework\">read the summary</a> in this post.

We took on the <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/daci\">DACI framework</a>, meaning one person would drive the project, one person would approve the project’s results, a select few would contribute to the project, and everyone else would be informed.</p>\n<p>The working group consisted of four people:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/team#chris-pine\">Chris Pine</a>, engineering manager, was the driver.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/team#nick-snyder\">Nick Snyder</a>, VP of Engineering, was the approver.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/team#felix-becker\">Felix Becker</a> and <a href=\"https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/team#patrick-dubroy\">Patrick Dubroy</a>, both engineering managers, were contributors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Everyone else in engineering was to be informed of the project’s progress and results.</p>\n<p>The team, sans Nick, met once a week for half an hour each. We did most of the work <a href=\"https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/company/asynchronous-communication\">asynchronously</a> and reported, weekly, to engineering leadership.</p>\n<p>In accordance with our <a href=\"https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/company/values#open-and-transparent\">transparency value</a>, we worked in the open. All proposals were in Google Docs that we shared with the entire company. We also asked engineering managers to bring it up in their one-one-ones. If people weren’t comfortable with that directness, we also created an anonymous feedback form.</p>\n<p>Even candidates got a peek at the framework:</p>\n<div>\n<object role=\"image\" data=\"https://sourcegraphstatic.com/blog/engineering-framework-images/nick-slack-message-career-framework.svg\" aria-label=\"Nick, informing the working group via Slack, that he shared our work with a candidate.\"></object>\n</div>\n<p>We united around a passion for career growth. We often spent time talking about the specific, minute wordings of different sentences and bullet points. We considered every sentence and bullet point from multiple angles, asking questions like “What if someone takes this too literally?” and “How do we word this in a way that we don’t encourage the wrong sort of behavior?”</p>\n<h2 id=\"Sourcegraph-prior-to-the-framework\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Sourcegraph-prior-to-the-framework\" aria-label=\"Sourcegraph prior to the framework permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Sourcegraph prior to the framework</h2>\n<p>Prior to the framework, engineering managers weren’t confident they were talking about career development in a way that was consistent with other engineering managers. Without a career framework, engineering managers and their reports were left without a shared language.</p>\n<p>This worked when we were small but threatened to become dysfunctional as we scaled. As we added teams, we worried engineering managers were having, or would start having, completely different conversations about what growth looked like.</p>\n<p>It was clear these challenges were only going to increase over time. If we were to continue scaling, and we certainly <a href=\"https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/announcing-sourcegraphs-series-d-round/\">wanted to scale</a>, then we needed to start solving these problems for the future.

As we scaled and made more and more offers, we found we needed the ability to evaluate an ever wider spectrum of hires. We needed to know we were consistently making fair offers.</p>\n<p>Fairness was hard to ensure. How, for instance, could we know that hiring manager A was making an offer that’s consistent with what hiring manager B would make?

The system was not set up to be fair and at some point, someone was going to be treated unfairly.</p>\n<p>A framework forces managers to compare their assessment of how someone is doing and compare that to an objective list of expectations. Cultural differences, for example, can produce different assessments.</p>\n<p>Our working group, based on their own experiences, noted that what’s considered a positive statement in Germany, for example, might be different from what’s considered a positive statement in the U.S. (Patrick, who lives in Germany, pointed out this particular dynamic). In other words, what might feel like the straight reporting of facts in one culture might feel like bragging in another culture.</p>\n<p>The framework provided concreteness, which shifted the evaluation process closer to objectivity.

Generally, companies fall into three options: annual, semi-annual, and quarterly.</p>\n<p>This may feel like a small difference but it plays a major role in how engineering managers and ICs feel about reviews.

According to the <a href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2016/02/15/spotify-technology-career-steps/#titles\">titles section of their career framework</a>, an IC’s “step” (Spotify’s term for level) doesn’t map to a title.

We also paid special attention to engineers who had been at Sourcegraph a long time so as to make sure there were no concerns from the people who knew Sourcegraph best.</p>\n<p>In some cases, those feedback requests resulted in a cautious thumbs-up. Engineers liked the idea of a framework, and wanted to try what the working group had produced, but also wanted to remain open to changing the framework if it didn’t work.

We wanted ICs to be able to reference it easily and efficiently as they went about their work. There was a tradeoff–other companies’ frameworks may indeed be more comprehensive–but we felt it was worth it. Better, we thought, to focus on the practical, real-world value released by something easier to use.</li>\n<li><strong>Clarity</strong>: where other frameworks were long, having 10 or more categories and complex point systems, ours was short and clear. We wanted ICs to be able to grasp the framework intuitively and avoid getting lost in the weeds.</li>\n<li><strong>Impact</strong>: where other frameworks emphasized scope, ours emphasized impact. At all times, we wanted engineering managers to be asking their ICs, and ICs to be asking themselves, “What is the impact you’re having?” That impact might be cross-team and that impact might be on one team, but it needs to be significant.</li>\n<li><strong>Example-driven</strong>: where other frameworks provided checklists of items to be completed, ours provided illustrative examples and models. We wanted to design a system that couldn’t be hacked or gamed, a system where ICs have to consistently demonstrate a certain level of impact.</li>\n<li><strong>Bias-resistant</strong>: where the lack of a framework opens a company up to promoting different people for different (often unfair or unjust) reasons, ours provided objective criteria by which engineering managers could evaluate team members.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below, we highlight some especially important aspects of the resulting career development framework, all of which you can <a href=\"https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/engineering/career-development\">read about in detail in our handbook</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Expectations\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Expectations\" aria-label=\"Expectations permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Expectations</h3>\n<p>Levels for Sourcegraph ICs range from L1 to L6 and each level contains three axes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proficiency</li>\n<li>Execution</li>\n<li>Teamwork</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A fewer number of axes is easier to assess and discuss. More axes, we found in our research, led to confusion because the distinctions between can get fuzzy. You can imagine how a given behavior might be hard to categorize in either a “Mentorship” or “Community” axis, for example.</p>\n<p>Our framework notes that “what is listed in the level descriptions are example behaviors, and not checkboxes for promotion.” Our framework also makes clear that “doing everything listed there is neither necessary nor sufficient for a promotion.”</p>\n<p>The above three axes cross-influence each other. You can’t, in other words, be great technically while having no teamwork or execution skills.</p>\n<p>We also wanted to avoid what’s often known as the <a href=\"https://insights.dice.com/2018/08/23/5-reasons-avoid-hiring-rockstar-developers/\">“rockstar developer” or “10x programmer” character</a>, the person who ships code but refuses to work with the rest of the team.

It was only when we scaled that we realized a framework had become necessary.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Start-from-the-known-before-heading-into-the-unknown\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Start-from-the-known-before-heading-into-the-unknown\" aria-label=\"Start from the known before heading into the unknown permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Start from the known before heading into the unknown</h3>\n<p>In the beginning, starting was hard. Where do you begin? How do you write down things and put them into levels? The blank page was one of our biggest challenges.</p>\n<p>To combat writer’s block, we started with the level we were most familiar with: senior engineer. From there, we built levels above and below it. Starting from a place of familiarity gave us something we could iterate on. At first, the senior engineer level was more robust than the others, which required editing, but it was worth it to get the kickstart.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Sweat-the-details\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Sweat-the-details\" aria-label=\"Sweat the details permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Sweat the details</h3>\n<p>At the end of the day, you’re talking about tiny bullet points.

Don’t copy us, but do learn from us.</p>\n<p>Do your research first. We weren’t originally going to do outside research, but Nick suggested it. Instinctually, we wanted to rely on our collective years of engineering management experience but the research process turned out to be transformative.</p>\n<p>By doing the research first, we were able to see how other companies designed their frameworks and identify which ones were closest to what we wanted to do.</p>\n<p>We realized that even the wisdom of three experienced engineering managers was limited. Most of us, after all, had only worked at a handful of companies.</p>\n<p>Research gives you a map of the territory, which you can then use to figure out where you want to be different. You’re, in effect, leveraging exponentially more years of experience by using the experience encoded in different frameworks.</p>\n<p>Research got us to a quality solution faster than if we had just tried to completely make it up from scratch.</p>\n<h3 id=\"But-dont-copy-paste\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#But-dont-copy-paste\" aria-label=\"But dont copy paste permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>But don’t copy-paste</h3>\n<p>Our career development framework is going to look different than any other framework. That’s both a deliberate choice of ours and a natural consequence of a principle we internalized early on: the purpose of a career development framework is to align career development at a given company with that particular company’s values.</p>\n<p>Each company has a different perspective on what’s important and what they value, so your career development framework should match that.
