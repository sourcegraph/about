We ask ourselves that a lot at <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com\">Sourcegraph</a>. It’s one of the questions in <a href=\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html\">The Joel Test</a>, Joel Spolsky’s classic 12-question benchmark of your team’s software engineering practices.</p>\n<p>Since he published the test in 2000, the <em>“best tools money can buy”</em> have dramatically improved. Code review, better editors/IDEs, GitHub, etc. But now you also demand more. It’s not crazy to be using 5 programming languages, multiple repositories, 2 package managers, 200 open source dependencies, several linters, a complex frontend build pipeline, etc.</p>\n<p>So, we made <strong>The Sourcegraph Test</strong> to measure how well your tools help you manage the reality of modern development:</p>\n<h3 id=\"The-Sourcegraph-Test\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#The-Sourcegraph-Test\" aria-label=\"The Sourcegraph Test permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>The Sourcegraph Test</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Do you have jump-to-def in your primary language and editor?</li>\n<li>Does your jump-to-def work across repository boundaries?</li>\n<li>Do you have find-references in your primary language and editor?</li>\n<li>Do you have inline error messages and diagnostics in your primary language and editor?</li>\n<li>Do you have jump-to-def in your primary editor for <em>all</em> of the languages you use?</li>\n<li>Does everyone else on your team satisfy the above 5 questions at least as well as you do?</li>\n<li>Can you search over all of your code and dependencies in one place?</li>\n<li>Do you receive and perform code reviews?</li>\n<li>Do you have jump-to-def and find-references in your code review tool?</li>\n<li>Do you have jump-to-def and find-references in your code host?</li>\n<li>Can you review and discuss code even after it has been merged?</li>\n<li>Does your code review process use any form of checklist (i.e., it’s not completely up to the discretion of the reviewer)?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Give yourself a <strong><em>yes</em></strong> (1 point each) or <strong><em>no</em></strong> (0 points) for each question.

Tracking down the source of a bug takes an extra 5 minutes here, figuring out the impact of a change in a code review takes 10 minutes more, refactoring a method name via plain-text search adds half an hour on top of that — small numbers, maybe, but they add up fast, and they get more costly as your team grows. Any team that’s wasting 20% of their day is falling behind competitors and is being drained of their creative energy to create amazing products.</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"http://sourcegraph.com\">Sourcegraph</a>, we think every developer — in every company, in every language, working on any kind of code — deserves to be 12/12. See the <a href=\"https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/company/strategy\">Sourcegraph master plan</a> for how we’re working to make that possible.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=My%20dev%20tools%20are%20at%20__%2F12%20on%20the%20%23sourcegraphtest%20https%3A%2F%2Ftext.sourcegraph.com%2Fthe-sourcegraph-test-12-more-steps-to-better-code-e5c281850c&#x26;source=webclient&#x26;via=sourcegraph&#x26;related=sourcegraph\"><strong>Share your score on Twitter!</strong> ➜</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: The Sourcegraph Test is v0.9 so we can incorporate any feedback before finalizing it.
