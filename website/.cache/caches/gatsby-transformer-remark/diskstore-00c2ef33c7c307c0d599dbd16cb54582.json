I have a challenge question here, which has come up, I think in these other conversations, which is when you’re bringing new folks onto the team, you try to transfer as much knowledge and context from the existing folks to the newer folks. And every company does this and you get the newest folks spun up and they’re getting the motion of contributing bug fixes and improvements to the existing codebase. But often what’s harder is transferring that complete historical context that gives people the confidence and the knowledge to make these big sweeping changes, like a big change to the architecture.","position":{"start":{"line":68,"column":16,"offset":10101},"end":{"line":68,"column":626,"offset":10711},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":68,"column":1,"offset":10086},"end":{"line":68,"column":626,"offset":10711},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"strong","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Beyang Liu:","position":{"start":{"line":70,"column":3,"offset":10715},"end":{"line":70,"column":14,"offset":10726},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":70,"column":1,"offset":10713},"end":{"line":70,"column":16,"offset":10728},"indent":[]}},{"type":"text","value":" And sometimes teams get stuck in this mode where the original authors of the team have now left, all the people currently working on it are people who have joined after that first initial stage.
