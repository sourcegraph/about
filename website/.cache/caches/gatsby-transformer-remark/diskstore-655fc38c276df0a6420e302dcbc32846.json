Organizations like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4lArxTWiIY\">Bell Labs in the 1980s, Sun Microsystems and Linux in the 1990s, and Mozilla, Google, and Facebook in the 2000s</a> built code search engines for their own teams to make their massive codebases accessible to every developer and enable permissionless knowledge sharing.</p>\n<p>These days, every company is becoming a software company, and everyone is reaching the scale of code where the need for search becomes apparent. The world of open source has exploded and the number of dependencies pulled into the average codebase has ballooned. There may no longer be such a thing as a small codebase—even boilerplate starter projects often require dozens of dependencies from the get-go. All these become part of the overall codebase, which developers must understand if they are to effectively build, test, debug, and deploy the code into production.</p>\n<p>We could try to boil developer productivity down to a scientific-sounding set of numerical metrics, but all such measures we’ve encountered seem deeply flawed in a way that confuses the creative essence of programming with the spreadsheet mechanics of a widget factory.</p>\n<p>When we think about developer productivity, we think of developer happiness. The value that great code search brings to organizations—in the form of human time saved, reduced downtime, collaborative knowledge transfer, and a faster pace of iteration and innovation—traces directly back to the delight and joy we bring to developers’ day-to-day lives.</p>\n<p>Think back to those moments when you first fell in love with programming. You sat down at a computer—maybe it was an <a href=\"https://slack.org/why-i-love-code\">old Apple Macintosh</a> or a <a href=\"https://medium.com/on-the-nature-of-certain-things/the-way-we-code-f4bb791c8d18\">TI-83 graphing calculator</a>—and got lost in hours of magical focus: thinking, tinkering, and tweaking your program until it was just right. At some point, you probably reached a flow state, that state of mind where all the context you need is mentally at hand, like it’s paged into your brain’s L1 cache, and you’re free to focus on the most creative and imaginative parts of the job. You were coding at the speed of thought.</p>\n<p>We’re building Sourcegraph to bring you back to that feeling every single day. The hard part is getting there. <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/835238-indeed-the-ratio-of-time-spent-reading-versus-writing-is\">Devs spend 10x the time reading code as they do writing it</a>. And the reading is often much less fun than the writing is—you’re not sure where to start, you’re down yet another rabbithole, you’re managing multiple editor windows and browser tabs, you feel tethered to the familiar parts of the code. Who among us has never looked at a library function and thought, “Thar be dragons!”</p>\n<p>Great code search illuminates all corners of the world of code and brings that universe of shared human knowledge to the fingertips that type out the search query. It encompasses code navigation and other contextual information that makes code easier to grok. It makes the entirety of your code—the code you wrote, the code your teammates wrote, all the code in your company, and all the code in open source, in any language, on any code host—immediately accessible. The most developer-forward organizations have been using it for years. We’re bringing it to every developer and <a href=\"https://slack.org/why-i-love-code#coding-for-all\">every single person</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Building-great-code-search-for-everyone\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Building-great-code-search-for-everyone\" aria-label=\"Building great code search for everyone permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Building great code search for everyone</h2>\n<p>How are we doing that? Well, we’ve taken great inspiration from a variety of sources—other code search engines (Livegrep, OpenGrok, Hound, Google Code Search, and Zoekt to name a few) built by amazing developers, the feedback of our early users and customers who shared our conviction in the value of code search, and our own intuition and direct experience as developers with a passion for building, collaborating, and educating. Looking toward the future, here are the areas where we’re planning to invest to push the frontiers of code search and put it in the hands of everyone:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Global scale at instant speed</li>\n<li>Accessible design that is both intuitive and expressive</li>\n<li>Cross-language compiler-accurate code navigation</li>\n<li>Developer-driven insights and change management</li>\n<li>Open extensibility, compatibility, and integrations</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"Global-scale-at-instant-speed\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Global-scale-at-instant-speed\" aria-label=\"Global scale at instant speed permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Global scale at instant speed</h2>\n<p>We think that really good code search needs to index the complete world of knowledge the user is hoping to explore, and it needs to be really, really fast.

Our core application is open source. Our paid product includes enterprise-specific features, and any individual developer can run their own instance for free.</li>\n<li>Future extension ideas include deeper editor integrations and embeddable interactive code snippets, and we love hearing additional ideas from users and customers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All this is the tip of the iceberg of what we have planned. Our latest fundraise allows us to make faster progress toward shipping these features to developers everywhere and focus on our long-term mission. We believe great code search should be available to every developer in the world.
