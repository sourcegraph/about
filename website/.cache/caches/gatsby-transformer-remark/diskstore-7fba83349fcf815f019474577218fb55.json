Lloyd Tabb, Ben Porterfield, and Frank Bien at Looker are building the data platform that I have been craving since I started working in technology. Nat Friedman and Miguel de Icaza at Xamarin brought mobile development to millions of experienced C# developers. The MySQL founders and Marten Mickos as CEO brought us the database that powered the web. I now get to work with Quinn Slack and Beyang Liu of Sourcegraph, two founders who are changing how the world develops software.</p>\n<p> When I first met with Quinn to learn about Sourcegraph, I was blown away. His vision of the future of software development opened my eyes to the incredible market opportunity Sourcegraph has. His humble confidence and vision of the future convinced me this was someone I needed to work with.</p>\n<p> Getting to know Beyang has been a similar experience. Don’t let his quiet demeanor fool you. He spends most of his day in the codebase architecting Sourcegraph, but he is equally as passionate and dynamic as Quinn. When called to address the company or board, he immediately commands the audience.</p>\n<p> Quinn and Beyang have helped build an amazing culture and an amazing team at Sourcegraph. No one at the company was surprised when they were chosen for the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kathleenchaykowski/2017/01/03/30-under-30-2017-the-young-innovators-transforming-enterprise-tech/#194e1c333754\"><em>Forbes</em> “30 under 30”</a> list.</p>\n<img src=\"//images.contentful.com/le3mxztn6yoo/3UJwVV13zaSqAySCIUY8gI/c85ad5e7a09ba7d07115e05b303ee285/1_sccXLEMQ6GSZN81h_1CJSg.png\" alt=\"1*sccXLEMQ6GSZN81h 1CJSg\">\n<p>I asked each of them about the recognition from <em>Forbes</em> and they had similar responses. Quinn said, “We just want to help developers ship better software faster. We love anything that brings attention to our mission.” Beyang’s response was, “It’s an honor to be included with all these talented entrepreneurs. I hope the increased visibility will help us connect with like-minded people around the world who share our passion for making great software and tools for developers.” Then they both went back to work with the team building Sourcegraph.</p>\n<p>You can learn more about the Sourcegraph and our vision from the <a href=\"https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/company/strategy\">Sourcegraph master plan</a>.
