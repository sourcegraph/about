Would love to use Go kit as it is, but there are some issues. Some of Go kit’s explicit non-goals are gizmo’s goals. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go kit non-goal: supporting messaging patterns other than RPC. But NYTimes needs to support messaging patterns other than RPC</li>\n<li>Go kit non-goal: be opinionated. But NYTimes needed a somewhat opinionated framework at NYTimes to unify a bunch of disparate services.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"gizmo-packages\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#gizmo-packages\" aria-label=\"gizmo packages permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>gizmo packages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>gizmo/server/metrics (based on Go kit metrics)</li>\n<li>gizmo/pubsub</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As time goes on, gizmo’s packages are starting to look more and more like Go kit’s.
