We try our best to keep these migrations fast, as a slow migration will block additional container instances from starting and accepting traffic.</p>\n<p>Some classes of migrations are very difficult to do efficiently:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Index creation over large tables requires a full table lock</li>\n<li>Concurrent index creation cannot be applied within a transaction</li>\n<li>Concurrent index creation takes much longer, can be blocked for an arbitrary amount of time due to live transactions, and can fail requiring an operator to rebuild the index (cherry on top: reindex is not concurrent)</li>\n<li>Data migrations over large tables can take an arbitrary amount of time</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/release/3.25/\">Sourcegraph 3.25</a> introduced a mechanism for performing out-of-band migrations. Instead of being applied synchronously on application startup, out-of-band migrations are applied in the application background over a longer period of time.</p>\n<p>Each migration is written in a generic way that allows it to be controlled by a global migration runner. This runner is responsible for controlling the throughput of the migration so that it does not require disproportionate memory or compute resources in the database or in the application.</p>\n<p>Each migration is required to report its own progress (0-100%) to aid the runner in determining the set of migrations which need to run (and in which direction they must run in the presence of downgrades).</p>\n<p>We ran into problems with Postgres 9.6 triggers when trying to implement an out-of-band migration to re-encode the way code intelligence data is stored. A few tables in the codeintel database stores <a href=\"https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/gob/\">gob</a>-encoded payloads in a <code class=\"language-text\">bytea</code> column. In order to migrate this data into another shape, we need to read these payloads in batches, perform the data migration over each row (in Go, which can properly decode/re-encode the data), and then write the new payloads back to the database.</p>\n<p>We chose to add a <code class=\"language-text\">version</code> column to these tables so that the backend can determine how to properly interpret the payload of a particular row. This way, both old and new payload shapes can be read while new rows are written with the new shape, and old rows are <em>eventually</em> rewritten into the new shape.</p>\n<p>This is where the tradeoffs come in to play.</p>\n<p>In our <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/search\">Cloud</a> environment, the <code class=\"language-text\">lsif_data_definitions</code> table contains around 300 million rows. Simply counting the number of rows takes around 24 minutes on our production database instance, as seen by the following (simplified) query plan:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">Finalize Aggregate\n -&gt; Gather\n     Workers Planned: 2\n     Workers Launched: 2\n      -&gt; Partial Aggregate\n          -&gt; Parallel Index Only Scan using lsif_data_definitions_pkey on lsif_data_definitions\n              Heap Fetches: 14939021\nPlanning Time: 1.241 ms\nExecution Time: 1442409.435 ms\n(9 rows)</code></pre></div>\n<p>Postgres requires that each returned row be visible to the current transaction as a way to prevent serving phantom data that was deleted by a previous query. Unfortunately, row visibility information is not stored in the index, but in the heap entry for the row.</p>\n<p>As explained in the <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/indexes-index-only-scans.html\">documentation</a> for index-only scans, partially visible pages require a heap access to check which rows are visible and which are not. These heap access and visibility checks dominate the running time of this query.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Speeding-up-counting-queries\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Speeding-up-counting-queries\" aria-label=\"Speeding up counting queries permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Speeding up counting queries</h3>\n<p>A near half-hour query is not <em>efficient</em>. Due to the consequences caused by Postgres <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/mvcc-intro.html\">MVCC</a>, there are few actions under our control that could make a count of so many objects faster. Instead, we should count fewer things.</p>\n<p>In our naïve attempt to determine the progress of a particular migration, we wanted to simply report the ratio between the number of rows with a version <em>above</em> our target and the total number of rows in the table. However, we don’t need progress reporting to be completely accurate (except for at the 0% and 100% edges).</p>\n<p>Each table we care to migrate in the codeintel database has a composite primary key containing an <em>index identifier</em>. Each unique index identifier corresponds to a precise code intelligence index file uploaded by a user.</p>\n<p>Instead of counting the ratio between migrated <em>rows</em> and total rows (which is very large), we can instead count the ratio between migrated <em>indexes</em> and total indexes (which is orders of magnitude smaller - 300 million vs. 23 thousand).</p>\n<p>The <strong>obvious approach</strong> would be to migrate all rows in a table associated with the same index at once. Unfortunately, indexes can be very massive. Some large customers are regularly uploading 13GB index files. Thus, our migration batch size is likely going to be too small to guarantee all rows can be migrated, and increasing the batch size will add additional memory and compute constraints on the migrating container.</p>\n<p>The <strong>approach we chose</strong> tracks the minimum and maximum row versions for each index in a separate, <em>much</em> smaller table.</p>\n<p><em>lsif</em>data<em>definitions</em>:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>index_id</th>\n<th>scheme</th>\n<th>identifier</th>\n<th>data</th>\n<th>version</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>foo</td>\n<td>bar</td>\n<td>…</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>bar</td>\n<td>baz</td>\n<td>…</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>baz</td>\n<td>quux</td>\n<td>…</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>quux</td>\n<td>bonk</td>\n<td>…</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>bonk</td>\n<td>honk</td>\n<td>…</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><em>lsif</em>data<em>definitions</em>schema<em>versions</em>:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>index_id</th>\n<th>min_version</th>\n<th>max_version</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This second table allows us to efficiently determine which indexes have been migrated and which still need attention. For example, if we are currently migrating from schema version 1 to 2, then the table above shows index 1 is partially migrated, index 2 is fully migrated, and index 3 has yet to be touched.</p>\n<p>It is an efficient operation to count both the total number of indexes as well as the number of indexes that are above or below a particular schema version.</p>\n<p>The schema version bounds can be kept in sync with the source table trivially by using triggers on inserts, updates, and deletes: if we insert a new row with a new lowest or new highest version or if we update/delete a row with the last remaining lowest or highest version, then we update the associated minimum or maximum version for that index.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Analyzing-the-trade-offs\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Analyzing-the-trade-offs\" aria-label=\"Analyzing the trade offs permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Analyzing the trade-offs</h3>\n<p>Engineering performance around a database is full of trade-offs. In this case, we’ve gained faster counts by sacrificing efficiency of inserts.</p>\n<p>After processing a precise code intelligence index file, we insert data in Postgres utilizing very large bulk insert operations. During this process, we insert tens to hundreds of thousands of rows over multiple tables for each index, but we don’t make tens of thousands of requests. As of this post, our <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/search\">Cloud</a> environment has a single precise code intelligence index with ~390k rows in the definitions table alone. Each precise code intelligence index has over 12k rows in this table on average.</p>\n<p>For each insertion query, we supply as many rows as possible (Postgres has a limit of 65535 values per query). This reduces the total number of round trips to the database, but also minimizes the number of total queries (and invocations of statement-level triggers).</p>\n<p>We are unable to utilize a statement-level trigger approach in Postgres 9.6 as such triggers would not know the value of the <code class=\"language-text\">index_id</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">version</code> columns of newly inserted rows. This leaves us with row-level triggers only, and such an approach would double the number of writes to the database: for each row inserted in the target table there is another upsert to the schema versions table.</p>\n<p>So how bad would this approach be?</p>\n<div class=\"no-shadow\">\n  <img src=\"https://sourcegraphstatic.com/blog/postgres-version-update/postgres-version-update-latency.png\" alt=\"performance comparison\">\n</div>\n<p>Turns out it’s pretty bad. Inserting 800k rows into the database with statement-level triggers takes under a minute (on a non-production test machine). Using row-level triggers the same operation takes over an hour.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Conclusion\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Conclusion\" aria-label=\"Conclusion permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In order to enable us to continue to scale and improve the performance of your Sourcegraph instance, we are bumping the minimum supported version of Postgres to unlock new features and performance enhancements.</p>\n<p>Once you plan to upgrade to Sourcegraph 3.27, you must first ensure that your database meets the new minimum version requirement of Postgres 12.
