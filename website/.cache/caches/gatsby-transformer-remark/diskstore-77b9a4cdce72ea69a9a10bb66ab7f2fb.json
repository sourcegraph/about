Google has been a pioneer not only in scaling their own software systems but in figuring out how to build software effectively at scale. They’ve dealt with issues related to codebase volume, code discoverability, organizational knowledge sharing, and multi-service deployment at a level of sophistication that most other companies have not yet reached.
