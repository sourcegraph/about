As we’ve grown, we’ve learned a lot from <a href=\"https://zachholman.com/talk/how-github-uses-github-to-build-github/\">GitHub</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Development-Process\">Visual Studio Code</a>, <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/\">GitLab</a>, and other teams who have shared their internal processes, and we’re going to start doing the same.</p>\n<p>We’ll be publishing a series of posts here about how we build Sourcegraph. A few things make Sourcegraph and our development process different from many other companies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our product is for developers, so our developers naturally have a larger role in product  planning and user/customer interaction (compared to companies building products for salespeople, photographers, etc.).</li>\n<li>Our product needs to be super easy for a single developer to <a href=\"https://docs.sourcegraph.com/#quickstart\">set up</a>, get code search and intelligence on their organization’s codebase, and share with their entire team.</li>\n<li>Sourcegraph is self-hosted; organizations run the <a href=\"https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/install\">Docker image</a> or <a href=\"https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/install/cluster\">Kubernetes cluster</a> for Sourcegraph on their own servers. We can’t roll back or push out an automatic update. (<a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com\">Sourcegraph.com</a> is a public instance with only public code from GitHub.com and other sites; customers’ code never touches our servers.)</li>\n<li>Unlike many other developer-facing products, developers directly interact with our product and its UI. It’s not just running behind the scenes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All this means we need to communicate well internally and externally, and we need to ship a robust, high-quality product to customers on a consistent schedule.</p>\n<p>Our series will cover how we do:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Planning, building, and announcing our monthly releases (examples: <strong><a href=\"/blog/introducing-sourcegraph-server-2-6/\">version 2.6</a></strong>, <a href=\"/blog/introducing-sourcegraph-server-2-5/\">version 2.5</a>, <a href=\"/blog/introducing-sourcegraph-server-2-4/\">version 2.4</a>)</li>\n<li>Product planning and prioritization</li>\n<li>New feature proposals/plans</li>\n<li>Customer feedback and technical support</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/doKVs9\">Subscribe to email updates</a></strong> to get notified when the next posts in the series are published. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sourcegraph\">Tell us @sourcegraph</a> if there are other topics you’d like to hear about. We’re looking forward to sharing our team’s culture and processes!</p>"}
