It’s like different languages and different build systems and so the Tree-sitter approach is nice because it’s sort of like this… I mean, it’s not language-agnostic to the point where one grammar works for all languages. You have language specific grammars, but it is one kind of parser generator. And then you’re not compiling each language and you’re not trying to be build-system-aware. It’s almost like you get 80% of the way there in terms of accuracy and hope that the set of heuristics that reduce to patterns, like you were saying in the AST, for what looks like a definition or what looks like a valid reference for a given definition.","position":{"start":{"line":312,"column":1,"offset":38899},"end":{"line":312,"column":950,"offset":39848}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":312,"column":1,"offset":38899},"end":{"line":312,"column":950,"offset":39848}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Max Brunsfeld:","position":{"start":{"line":314,"column":3,"offset":39852},"end":{"line":314,"column":17,"offset":39866}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":314,"column":1,"offset":39850},"end":{"line":314,"column":19,"offset":39868}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":314,"column":1,"offset":39850},"end":{"line":314,"column":19,"offset":39868}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Yeah.

When working on Atom, we started with a hackable text editor that wasn’t very polished or good in most other ways, but besides being the most hackable it could possibly be, we were then trying to evolve it to become fast and powerful incrementally after shipping it and having all these locked-in APIs that we had to support.
