This is a common challenge for design teams everywhere: there are often many valid ways to solve a problem, each with its own set of tradeoffs and assumptions. A small team can rely on intuition, experience, and shared trust to make decisions in these moments. <strong>But gut instinct doesn’t scale.</strong></p>\n<p>The design and product teams were at an inflection point. That’s why we decided it was time to come together to define our product design principles. I’m going to go into how we did this and what principles we settled on, but first I’ll cover some basics:</p>\n<h2 id=\"What-are-product-design-principles\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#What-are-product-design-principles\" aria-label=\"What are product design principles permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>What are product design principles?</h2>\n<p>Product design principles are a set of statements co-created by the team to express a shared vision and values for the product.</p>\n<p>A strong set of product design principles gives the team a way to make <strong>consistent decisions</strong> based on a shared idea of what we’re trying to achieve. They <strong>introduce constraints</strong> that help reduce ambiguity, particularly when there’s more than one possible solution to a given problem.

Where design principles are simple, broadly applicable, and capture our shared vision and values, design patterns are the tangible and repeatable expression of our principles in combination with heuristics of good design and usability.</p>\n<p>Design principles don’t change often, as they reflect a core truth of who we are.
