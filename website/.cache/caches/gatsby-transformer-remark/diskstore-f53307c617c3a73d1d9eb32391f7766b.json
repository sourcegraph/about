He explored the code and submitted a pull request. It took 7 weeks for the change to be merged. He felt that the project was important, though, so he continued to contribute and invest in it. After awhile, one of the contributors invited Enrique to become a contributor himself.</p>\n<p>Open source projects die or fade for a variety of reasons: maintainers move on, lose interest. Why should we rescue projects?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It might be depended on by something somewhere</li>\n<li>Security and trust are important values of open source and to ensure these, the code needs to be kept up to date.</li>\n<li>There’s potential to build new features and fix new bugs that can benefit others.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>How can you start?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Writing documentation</li>\n<li>Contact the maintainers and express your gratitude</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even if a community is dormant, they can still be woken up and act as a team.

An open source library is going to some things well, other things poorly. Explain the tradeoffs before people point out the flaws. No solution is perfect.</p>\n<p><strong>“Know your matchups.”</strong> Tell different stories that appeal to different stakeholders.</p>\n<p><strong>“Understand the benefits of standing still vs moving forward.”</strong></p>\n<p><strong>“Learn to lose”</strong> — failure is feedback. Learn from losses so you can win the next battles.</p>\n<p><strong>“It’s never Game Over.”</strong> It’s only over when you quit trying.</p>"}
