With this milestone, we wanted to take a moment to reflect on this effort and what we’ve learned.</p>\n<p>Bringing organizations to Sourcegraph Cloud was a unique challenge for our team because it meant taking a self-hosted, enterprise-focused product, and turning it into a cloud software-as-a-service (SaaS) product as well.</p>\n<p>Sourcegraph helps companies to understand their code. All of it. No matter where it’s hosted. As an early-stage startup, Sourcegraph actually started as a cloud SaaS product before we realized that we needed to do more to earn trust with companies’ private code. This led us to pivot towards making Sourcegraph open source and self-hosted. Companies could look at Sourcegraph source code for themselves and run their Sourcegraph instance in their own trusted environment.</p>\n<p>This early decision was crucial to our success. Today, many of the world’s largest and most technologically advanced companies like Dropbox, General Electric, PayPal, <a href=\"/case-studies\">and many more</a> trust Sourcegraph with their private code, and we recently closed <a href=\"/blog/announcing-sourcegraphs-series-d-round/\">a $125M Series D funding</a> round to bring universal code search to every dev at every company of every size and scale.</p>\n<p>But we’ve heard again and again: for smaller companies with lean engineering teams that use SaaS products across their stack, the ease of deploying through SaaS outweighs the benefits of self-hosting. And for us to bring universal code search to every dev at <strong>every company of every size and scale</strong>, Sourcegraph needs to be effortless for these smaller companies to deploy.</p>\n<p>That’s where we saw an opportunity. We already had Sourcegraph Cloud, which helps developers to search the universe of open source software. Sourcegraph Cloud is the largest Sourcegraph instance in the world—it’s the same Sourcegraph, just bigger.</p>\n<p>We decided to make a big bet on Sourcegraph Cloud. And that meant figuring out how to get from self-hosted to also on cloud. <strong>We were there, came here, and now we wanted to go back again.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"Breaking-assumptions\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Breaking-assumptions\" aria-label=\"Breaking assumptions permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Breaking assumptions</h2>\n<p>Building a self-hosted product involves a lot of assumptions that break when turning it into a cloud SaaS:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All code on the instance belongs to the same organization.</li>\n<li>There is a person or team who can set up, orchestrate, and administrate Sourcegraph on the organization’s own stack and network.</li>\n<li>The instance admin will connect Sourcegraph with code hosts, and choose which repositories to add to Sourcegraph and make sure they sync properly.</li>\n<li>Running a global search on Sourcegraph will search across only your company’s repositories.</li>\n<li>All users on the Sourcegraph instance belong to the same company.</li>\n<li>A URL to a search result copied and pasted to someone else will “just work,” because everyone has access to the same code.</li>\n<li>There’s a high-touch, multi-stage sales process tailored for each customer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The extent of this list of assumptions gave us an idea of just how big this challenge was, especially when we knew we wanted to keep one Sourcegraph—we didn’t want to split out into separate “Cloud” and “Self-hosted” products.</p>\n<p>We needed to figure out how to solve each of these problems, but focusing on each of these broken assumptions as action items in themselves is an easy way to get bogged down in tactical details. Instead, we needed a big vision and incremental action.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Big-vision-incremental-action\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Big-vision-incremental-action\" aria-label=\"Big vision incremental action permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Big vision, incremental action</h2>\n<p>We needed to strike the balance between the long-term of what Sourcegraph Cloud would become and the concrete steps that would get us there.

This led to proposing and building <a href=\"/blog/introducing-search-contexts/\">search contexts</a>, an entirely new product feature, to solve this problem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Our RFCs are public to the world by default in line with our <a href=\"https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/company/values#open-and-transparent\">open and transparent values</a>.

Without identifying these foundations, we risked working ourselves into a corner by solving each problem in isolation, rather than as an incremental step within a bigger context.</p>\n<p>For us, these foundations turned out to be mostly conceptual: what does it mean to “add code?” What about “connecting with code hosts?” How might that be the same, but different, for an individual user versus an organization? How does code visibility work? What’s the difference between what we’re doing here, and multitenancy? What decisions do we make now that will open up a future path to multitenancy?</p>\n<p>We captured these decisions in async artifacts like an exploration of <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/10bvGT4lnHaRpne3zbHzEtld4Xv2x38DdIgaBPRNidXE/edit#\">how multitenancy affects existing assumptions around roles and permissions</a>, and an <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/15vIqi4SHUKYM4MJ80GLwLxQpoMJRCJVXUVuSZoYmrug/edit#\">information architecture summary</a>. Async artifacts like these are a core part of <a href=\"https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/company/asynchronous-communication\">how we work asynchronously</a> at Sourcegraph. They make it easy to share and provide thoughtful, considered feedback, and to revisit and build on our shared understanding of these foundations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"You-aint-gonna-need-it-yet\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#You-aint-gonna-need-it-yet\" aria-label=\"You aint gonna need it yet permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>You ain’t gonna need it (yet)</h3>\n<p>Having both a clear roadmap of problems and a good idea of the foundations helped us to keep moving forward without feeling like we needed to solve every problem all at once. A big part of this meant constantly revisiting what we needed to do now, and what could be done later.</p>\n<p>We know <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DqJWHmVHA6EpyKNAh0h-WNdsOprN8t-xTQbQ4CH8Z3I/edit\">we’ll need a strong invitation flow for organizations</a>. The way we connect with code hosts can keep improving. And we know we’ll eventually need things like self-service payments and subscription management. But we ain’t gonna need it <i>yet</i>.</p>\n<p>After launching private code for individual users on Cloud, we did a collaborative <a href=\"https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_l2ceJwU=/?invite_link_id=556797444102\">story-mapping workshop</a> to break out what we knew we’d need to do into a series of iterations that represented a fully functional, lovable product outcome.</p>\n<p>And, even today, we keep <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qFze1GDQhBdxe1xZ72HFH2XCBoOUd_4H5y7mxXUPsdg/edit#heading=h.1ogghndvekag\">thinking through our release milestones</a> to make it easier for our team to plan what we need to do next.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Recap-what-we-learned\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Recap-what-we-learned\" aria-label=\"Recap what we learned permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Recap: what we learned</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/sourcegraph-cloud-for-teams-now-in-private-beta/\">Launching early access for organizations</a> reflects a lot of work, and perfectly hits our goal: helping small teams to search across their private code together on Sourcegraph Cloud.</p>\n<p>We have lots more to do and we’re excited for the opportunities ahead, but we’re also celebrating what we’ve achieved and learned along the way:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Have a big vision.
