By then, we had already been hard at work on growing our global index: we had 1M open source repositories indexed, and had tackled some significant engineering challenges along the way, notably yielding a <a href=\"https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/zoekt-memory-optimizations-for-sourcegraph-cloud/\">5x reduction in RAM usage of Zoekt</a>, our trigram-based search backend. Today, Sourcegraph Cloud allows you to search over 2.2M open source repositories.</p>\n<p>Our original intention was to keep growing our global index to reach 5.5M repositories, or every GitHub.com and GitLab.com repository with more than one star. Along the way, we noticed this approach was missing some important OSS resources for developers. We re-evaluated the goal, reflected on the use cases universal OSS code search should enable for developers, and decided on a different target: rather than further growing our global index with more repositories from GitHub.com and GitLab.com, we’ll be focusing on broadening the set of code hosts Sourcegraph Cloud indexes from. In order to be truly universal, Sourcegraph Cloud shouldn’t limit itself to only repositories from the most popular code hosts: it should index <em>all open source code</em>. You can read more about <a href=\"#Lessons-learned\">how we reached this decision below</a>.</p>\n<p>We’ve already begun: today, you can search over <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=repo:%5Esrc.fedoraproject.org/\">34.5k repositories from Fedora Package Sources</a> on Sourcegraph Cloud alongside our existing corpus of repositories from GitHub.com and GitLab.com, and we’re looking forward to expanding this further. If you maintain an open source code host, and would like to see your repositories indexed on Sourcegraph Cloud, feel free to <a href=\"mailto:universal-search@sourcegraph.com\">get in touch with our Search Core team</a>!</p>\n<p>We’re incredibly excited by the possibilities opened by indexing code from many OSS code hosts in a common, blazing-fast code search engine:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As an author, your code no longer has to be hosted on one of the most popular platforms in order to be discoverable—it will be surfaced in search results right alongside code from a variety of sources. You can also see how your code is used by others, no matter where <em>their</em> code is hosted.</li>\n<li>As a developer searching for code, you are able to use this single, unified code search engine to find the projects and code examples most relevant to you across code hosts.</li>\n<li>With the ability to sync your private code on Sourcegraph Cloud, you can also seamlessly search your own code alongside all of its open source dependencies, across code host boundaries.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not only that, but we are also making progress on Sourcegraph Cloud’s support for private code. Last month we <a href=\"https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/sourcegraph-cloud-for-teams-now-in-private-beta\">opened a beta for teams access to Sourcegraph Cloud</a>.</p>\n<p>In short, with this focus on breadth in addition to depth, Sourcegraph Cloud is on the path to becoming <em>the</em> search engine for the universe of open source code along with your private code—a cornerstone for a world where <a href=\"https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/company/strategy#purpose\">everyone can code</a>. You can also use Sourcegraph Self-hosted to search, understand, and automate large-scale changes across all of your private code, wherever it’s hosted.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Lessons-learned\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Lessons-learned\" aria-label=\"Lessons learned permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Lessons learned</h2>\n<p>Do we regret setting our sights on 5.5M repos?
