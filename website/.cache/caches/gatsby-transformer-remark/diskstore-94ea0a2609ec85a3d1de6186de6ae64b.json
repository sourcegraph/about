But there can still be inconsistencies between the packages in use and a package manifest like <code class=\"language-text\">packages.json</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">go.mod</code>—a developer uses a new dependency without explicitly adding it, or removes one without removing it from the manifest.</p>\n<p>Make sure you’re running a check against this in your presubmit.

Then, use static code analysis tools to determine where your most significant dependencies come from and determine whether or not you can slim them down or remove them. One example is to only import what you need from the code (e.g., no star (*) imports)). Importing only what you need might not always reduce your bundle size, but will almost certainly clear up your global namespace so that you avoid potential conflicts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"The-Fourth-Circle-Greed-Multiple-package-managers\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#The-Fourth-Circle-Greed-Multiple-package-managers\" aria-label=\"The Fourth Circle Greed Multiple package managers permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>The Fourth Circle: <em>Greed</em>.

There are two ways to shortcut this complexity. First, you can simply allow two different versions of D. This works for some cases but doesn’t make sense for others. This resolution method is how most JavaScript package managers (npm and yarn) work. As a result, you can end up with many different copies of the same library, just at different versions.\nOther languages, like Go, only let you specify the minimum version of a dependency. If Go detects two different versions of the same dependency, it will attempt to use the newest minor version according to semantic versioning. If neither package shares a major version, it will error.
