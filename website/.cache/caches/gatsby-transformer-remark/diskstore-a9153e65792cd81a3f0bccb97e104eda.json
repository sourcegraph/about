When designing research for a product that is dependent on space and context, like understanding how a parent uses a shopping cart at the grocery store, you might perform an ethnographic study by taking a trip with them to their local grocery store to better familiarize yourself with their life and the decisions they make before, during, and after the trip. But for programmers (who can code wherever there’s enough space for a laptop), we just host our sessions here at our office in San Francisco. To do this, we prepare:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A testing laptop that runs a working prototype of Sourcegraph in a production environment and a second screen so everyone can see what the participant is doing in real time. An audio recording device (a smartphone is fine) is great for reviewing any feedback or dialogue later.</li>\n<li>A quiet place (any office with a closed door is fine) to conduct the interview to limit distractions.</li>\n<li>A cohort of users who actively use the product and are willing to give honest feedback, as well as a control group who has never used Sourcegraph before.</li>\n<li>Sticky notes and/or a whiteboard for later analysis.</li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"//images.contentful.com/le3mxztn6yoo/4ERYZHPMN2EiaoYY6OAMA8/9b474c0c40dce4975c2052ece22b73f3/0_flB7naFAbUKi1z8a.png\" alt=\"0*flB7naFAbUKi1z8a\">\n<p>The first iteration of our user research station.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Framing-the-research-what-are-you-trying-to-solve-for\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Framing-the-research-what-are-you-trying-to-solve-for\" aria-label=\"Framing the research what are you trying to solve for permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Framing the research: what are you trying to solve for?</h4>\n<p><em>Is your product a vitamin or a painkiller?</em></p>\n<p>This question is often used to identify the core value of a product and to understand the painpoints that a it addresses. It’s a great question to ask before you start your user research to help narrow your focus.</p>\n<p>The first thing you need to do is to define your core thesis — How does the product resonate with users? What kinds of problems does it solve? What product areas need messaging clarification or education? What hypotheses need to be tested? While you want to answer <em>every</em> question you have about your product, the reality is that you will probably only have time to interrogate one or two fundamental hypotheses in the span of a 1-hour conversation. Large corporate research is often plagued by a large number of stakeholders with different business needs that dilute the project’s focus and integrity, making it impossible to inform strategic decisions. If this happens to your team, you might as well have users take a Survey Monkey questionnaire for thin, broad insights.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Product-refinement-or-rapid-innovation\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Product-refinement-or-rapid-innovation\" aria-label=\"Product refinement or rapid innovation permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Product refinement or rapid innovation?</h4>\n<p>Your users won’t tell you how to build your product but with the right line of questioning, they can create a foundation of behavior to inform your product direction. As a developer, researcher, product manager, or combination of all three, your job is to package and prioritize your observations and to create solutions that anticipate future functional and emotional needs. As Henry Ford famously said, “If I had just listened to my customers I would have built a faster horse.” Our hypothesis was aimed at understanding the difference between how programmers currently search for code, and how they could potentially search for code and usage examples.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Testing-a-new-way-of-thinking\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Testing-a-new-way-of-thinking\" aria-label=\"Testing a new way of thinking permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Testing a new way of thinking</h4>\n<p>For our research, we wanted to test a completely new user interface to allow our users to explore annotated source code and examples, similar to the way we explore Wikipedia articles and find related but new information through our own curiosity. Can people actually think of code like this? If not, how can we change the limitations around how we interact with open source code? And what kind of new behaviors would this create? We started thinking of more questions than could ever be answered and settled on 3 main hypotheses to test around one of the most overlooked and necessary parts of a product: user education.</p>\n<p>With the page redesign, we focused on three questions for each section of our website:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Messaging: Do users understand what Sourcegraph does? If so, how deep does their product knowledge go?</li>\n<li>User needs and behavior: What are the first actions a user takes on each of the three pages we show them?</li>\n<li>Next steps: What are quick fixes and what are more strategic, long term improvements we can prioritize?</li>\n</ol>\n<img src=\"//images.contentful.com/le3mxztn6yoo/2aRrMbgbQM66ASaI4kiEaw/a0845d5a941553226a71fcb643914912/0_C0YDFBLNJ_tREgSj.png\" alt=\"0*C0YDFBLNJ tREgSj\">\n<p>A user giving feedback at our old office.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Recruiting-your-users\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Recruiting-your-users\" aria-label=\"Recruiting your users permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Recruiting your users</h3>\n<p>If you’re new to user research, it may be a good exercise to interview people you already know. We started by reaching out to friends and colleagues who were familiar with Sourcegraph from the beginning. With a strong rapport already in place, it’s a great time to test out your interviewing skills and find what questions create meaningful feedback.</p>\n<p>In order to talk to users who had little to no experience with Sourcegraph, we reached out to qualified candidates over Twitter and started asking our friends to reach out to their friends and get feedback on Sourcegraph. If you don’t have a large list of friends to draw from, you can always reach out to other programmers on Hacker News or other programmer-friendly sites, although expect to compensate them for $25–75/hr for their time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Discussion-guide-15-minutes\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Discussion-guide-15-minutes\" aria-label=\"Discussion guide 15 minutes permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Discussion guide (~15 minutes)</h3>\n<p>Getting to know each other: when a user comes into our office, we start the interview by asking very simple, open-ended questions to outline their current workflow for writing code.

Leading questions might sound like “would you say that…” or “do you like this feature?” They imply an answer that’s already been forecasted and don’t allow for true exploration of a topic. Your job isn’t to boost your ego but to understand the difference between what people do, and what they say they do.</p>\n<p>Instead, try these open-ended prompts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Tell me about your process.
