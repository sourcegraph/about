In fact, those languages now have better, faster support because they use the new architecture.</p>\n<p>We will also enable <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/extensions/sourcegraph/basic-code-intel\">basic code intelligence</a> on Sourcegraph.com, which provides best-effort (heuristic- and parser-based) code intelligence for all languages.

The new scheme makes it much easier for us (and others) to add more and better language support using <a href=\"https://langserver.org/\">existing language servers</a>.</p>\n<p>We apologize to users who used code intelligence for the affected languages on Sourcegraph.com for open source code, and we commit to bringing them back better than before. Because <a href=\"https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph\">Sourcegraph is open source</a> and you can run your own self-hosted Sourcegraph instance, there is a free and open source workaround to still get support for these languages.</p>\n<h3 id=\"How-do-I-get-code-intelligence-for-the-affected-languages\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#How-do-I-get-code-intelligence-for-the-affected-languages\" aria-label=\"How do I get code intelligence for the affected languages permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>How do I get code intelligence for the affected languages?</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/extensions/sourcegraph/basic-code-intel\">basic code intelligence</a> extension may suffice for your needs. You can enable it and use it on Sourcegraph.com for all languages.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, you can <a href=\"https://docs.sourcegraph.com/#quickstart\">run a self-hosted instance of Sourcegraph 2.13</a> to get language support for the removed languages. You’ll just need to add repositories to your instance and ensure it is running the language servers for your desired languages. To get code intelligence on your code host (e.g., GitHub), connect your <a href=\"https://docs.sourcegraph.com/integration/browser_extension\">Sourcegraph browser extension</a> to your Sourcegraph instance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"When-will-these-languages-be-re-added-to-Sourcegraphcom\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#When-will-these-languages-be-re-added-to-Sourcegraphcom\" aria-label=\"When will these languages be re added to Sourcegraphcom permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>When will these languages be re-added to Sourcegraph.com?</h3>\n<p>In the coming weeks and months, depending on the language. Our top priorities are Java and PHP (as well as introducing Swift support).</p>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/direction\">Sourcegraph roadmap</a> for a timeline of when these languages will be added back. If you don’t see a language listed yet, we don’t have a date to re-add it. If you’d like to contribute language support, let us know. We are <a href=\"https://github.com/sourcegraph/careers\">hiring software engineers</a>, or we can sponsor you as a part-time contributor.</p>"}
