Code Insights transforms any search query into customizable, visual dashboards in seconds. Code Insights reveals high-level information about your codebase, based on both how your code changes over time and its current state.</p>\n<p>If you’re already using Sourcegraph, upgrade to 3.37 for a limited trial of Code Insights or reach out to your account team to purchase access to the full version.</p>\n<div class=\"container my-4 video-embed embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\">\n  <iframe\n    class=\"embed-responsive-item\"\n    src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMCUJQHfbUA?autoplay=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;start=0&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;controls=1&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0\"\n    allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n    allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n    frameborder=\"0\"\n    title=\"Sourcegraph Code Insights demo\"\n  ></iframe>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"Code-Intelligence-LSIF-indexing-time-has-improved-30x-from-15m-to-30s\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Code-Intelligence-LSIF-indexing-time-has-improved-30x-from-15m-to-30s\" aria-label=\"Code Intelligence LSIF indexing time has improved 30x from 15m to 30s permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Code Intelligence LSIF indexing time has improved 30x (from 15m to 30s)</h2>\n<p>LSIF index processing just got a whole lot faster, so you can upload your indexes and start utilizing precise Code Intelligence immediately. Previously, certain LSIF indexes, especially for Javascript and Typescript, could take over 30 minutes to process. This meant that a long queue would build up with frequent uploads, such as those from a CI job that runs on every commit on a development branch. Now, most indexes should be processed in a few seconds instead of minutes so that you can access precise Code Intelligence soon after uploading an index.</p>\n<img class=\"blog-image\" title=\"LSIF upload speedup\" alt=\"Comparative chart before and after processing improvements.\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/blog/3.37/lsif-upload-speedup.png\">\n<p>The symbols sidebar also got a significant performance boost. Previously, the symbols sidebar would search for symbols in the whole directory tree, even if you were only looking at a subdirectory or file, which would cause it to time out and show an error message on big monorepos. Now prefix queries like <code class=\"language-text\">^src/app</code> are better optimized and subdirectory searches are much faster and less likely to time out.</p>\n<img class=\"blog-image\" title=\"Symbol's sidebar improvement\" alt=\"Comparative chart before and after symbol improvements.\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/blog/3.37/symbols-sidebar-improvement.png\">\n<h2 id=\"Share-Notebooks-with-your-organization\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Share-Notebooks-with-your-organization\" aria-label=\"Share Notebooks with your organization permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Share Notebooks with your organization</h2>\n<p>Notebooks are now shareable within organizations. Previously, you could only share Notebooks with your entire instance (or share them publicly, in the case of Sourcegraph Cloud). This update allows you to create Notebooks with specific relevance to your organization, such as documentation of preferred engineering patterns or anti-patterns. Your organization’s shared Notebooks will now show up in their own tabs on the <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/notebooks\">Notebooks home page</a>.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img class=\"blog-image\" title=\"Notebooks sharing\" alt=\"Image of Notebooks sharing modal.\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/docs/images/notebooks/notebook_sharing.png\">\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"Import-and-export-Notebooks-as-Markdown\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Import-and-export-Notebooks-as-Markdown\" aria-label=\"Import and export Notebooks as Markdown permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Import and export Notebooks as Markdown</h2>\n<p>Notebooks can now be created by uploading a Markdown file, so if you’re already working with Markdown documentation files, you can simply upload those files to add Sourcegraph snippets and turn them into full-fledged Notebooks. You can also export Notebooks to Markdown, allowing you to turn Sourcegraph Notebooks into repo-based Markdown files.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Create-search-contexts-with-the-new-UI\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Create-search-contexts-with-the-new-UI\" aria-label=\"Create search contexts with the new UI permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Create search contexts with the new UI</h2>\n<p>The search contexts creation UI has received visual tweaks, making it easier to understand if you’re using search queries or JSON to define your contexts.
