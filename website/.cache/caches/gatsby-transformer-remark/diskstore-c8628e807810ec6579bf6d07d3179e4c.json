Interception is common behavior with antivirus and enterprise firewall software, and they often break things and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FiloSottile/status/835269932929667072\">slow the adoption of new versions</a> of TLS.</p>\n<p>Although the heuristics we use aren’t always perfect, this feature has obvious value: expose potential censorship or malware, and warn users of the breach in their privacy.</p>\n<p>The idea is simple. It involves comparing the HTTP User-Agent header to the characteristics of the TLS ClientHello of the underlying connection. If the browser indicated by the User-Agent does not emit a ClientHello like the one seen for that connection, the connection is likely being intercepted. (Research shows that TLS proxies — benevolent or otherwise — are often careless about the client’s protocol preferences, and that nearly every browser and proxy has a unique fingerprint from the ClientHello alone.)</p>\n<p>The web server is in a unique position to detect these anomalies where the client is not able to. I figure Caddy should be able to do this and let the site owner decide how to handle the connection in that situation: log the event, redirect to an informational page, or inject a warning into the web page directly so the user can be informed that their connection is <em>not</em> private, despite any green lock in the browser. Caddy is, so far, the only web server to provide this feature (soon to be released).</p>\n<h3 id=\"Technical-Problems\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Technical-Problems\" aria-label=\"Technical Problems permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Technical Problems</h3>\n<p>Aside from the difficulty of getting the heuristics just right, there are a few issues specific to Caddy and Go that make this a non-trivial feature.</p>\n<p>Go’s <code class=\"language-text\">net/http</code> Handlers do not expose the underlying connection at all. This makes it difficult to match an <code class=\"language-text\">http.Request</code> to the <code class=\"language-text\">net.Conn</code> and thus the TLS ClientHello, which we need to compare against the User-Agent header at request time.

Go 1.8 now has a <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/golang/go@b660a4b04d0a88e86d15c1235a4d3bdf1efcd12c/-/blob/src/crypto/tls/common.go#L405:1-406:1\"><code class=\"language-text\">GetConfigForClient</code></a> callback that makes the <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/golang/go@b660a4b04d0a88e86d15c1235a4d3bdf1efcd12c/-/blob/src/crypto/tls/common.go#L241:6-241:21\"><code class=\"language-text\">ClientHelloInfo</code></a> struct available (a struct which has more fields as of Go 1.8), but the information in that struct is not sufficient for executing the heuristics.

No thanks. So, buffering it is. Fortunately, the ClientHello is the first message of a TLS handshake (preceded only by a short 5-byte header).</p>\n<p>We could implement our own <code class=\"language-text\">Accept()</code> method which reads the bytes we need before returning with the underlying <code class=\"language-text\">Accept()</code>. But don’t forget— <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/golang/go@db6e27c38d20cdd6af205bbf99c1b1d3327e6c6f/-/blob/src/net/http/server.go#L2648:1-2650:1\"><code>Accept()</code></a> is a blocking call in the HTTP server loop. Never read from the network in the same goroutine as the server’s <code class=\"language-text\">Accept()</code> loop; you won’t be able to accept new connections until you’ve finished reading from the previous one! That is bad, even for just a few hundred bytes.</p>\n<p>What’s the alternative? We can’t block on <code class=\"language-text\">Accept()</code>, but there’s a function that’s specifically for reading from the network, and it runs in its own goroutine: <code class=\"language-text\">net.Conn.Read()</code>. So I implemented my own “wrapper” over the standard <code class=\"language-text\">net.Conn</code> type:</p>\n<pre name=\"c54c\" id=\"c54c\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">type clientHelloConn struct {\n    net.Conn\n    listener  *tlsHelloListener\n    readHello bool\n    buf       *bytes.Buffer\n}</pre>\n<p>We have it keep a reference to the listener so it can store the parsed data in the map.</p>\n<p>Back to the <code class=\"language-text\">tlsHelloListener</code> for a moment. Right now, it acts like the plain TCP listener embedded inside it. We need to make it act like a TLS listener:</p>\n<pre name=\"3b4d\" id=\"3b4d\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">func (l *tlsHelloListener) Accept() (net.Conn, error) {\n    conn, err := l.Listener.Accept()\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, err\n    }\n    helloConn := &clientHelloConn{\n        Conn:     conn,\n        listener: l,\n        buf:      new(bytes.Buffer),\n    }\n    return tls.Server(helloConn, l.config), nil\n}</pre>\n<p>Ah, much better! No blocking, and we can still hook into the connection by implementing <code class=\"language-text\">Read()</code> on our <code class=\"language-text\">clientHelloConn</code>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Reading-the-Raw-ClientHello-Bytes-Off-the-Wire\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Reading-the-Raw-ClientHello-Bytes-Off-the-Wire\" aria-label=\"Reading the Raw ClientHello Bytes Off the Wire permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Reading the Raw ClientHello Bytes Off the Wire</h4>\n<p>This is tricky. Not only are we dealing with highly volatile network environments, but these are also TLS connections, which are highly sensitive to mistakes.</p>\n<p>The first iteration of our <code class=\"language-text\">Read()</code> is a simple pass-thru that doesn’t do anything custom:</p>\n<pre name=\"c886\" id=\"c886\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">func (c *clientHelloConn) Read(b []byte) (n int, err error) {\n    return c.Conn.Read(b)\n}</pre>\n<p>Booorrrring. So what do we know? We know that we need to read the ClientHello if it hasn’t already been read. But if it has, our job is done, and it can carry on as if we weren’t there:</p>\n<pre name=\"2067\" id=\"2067\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">func (c *clientHelloConn) Read(b []byte) (n int, err error) {\n    if c.readHello {\n        return c.Conn.Read(b)\n    }\n    // TODO: read the ClientHello\n}</pre>\n<p>We can replace our TODO with some code to read the header:</p>\n<pre name=\"249b\" id=\"249b\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">hdr := make([]byte, 5)\nn, err = io.ReadFull(c.Conn, hdr)\nif err != nil {\n    return\n}</pre>\n<p>From this header we get the length of the ClientHello and can read that many bytes. Put this into an <code class=\"language-text\">io.MultiReader</code> for the standard lib to do the rest. <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/mholt/caddy@0a0d2cc1cf12d58c5e38680689c78f18044288e6/-/blob/caddyhttp/httpserver/mitm.go#L104:1-105:1\">Done.</a></p>\n<p>Easy, right? <strong>Danger, danger!</strong> We are reading bytes from an untrusted client for a sensitive protocol that impacts the security of the rest of the connection. Is this a real connection or an attack? What about timeouts/deadlines? What about all the edge cases that the standard library handles, like clients that don’t speak TLS or malicious handshake records? We’re asking for trouble trying to do this ourselves and assuming that the client is virtuous.</p>\n<p>So scratch that <code class=\"language-text\">ReadFull()</code>code above. We’re going to let the standard library do all the reading from the wire and we’ll mooch on what it gets for us. It will take care of timeouts and most edge cases, drastically reducing the error surface. What the standard lib reads in, we will have copied to our little buffer:</p>\n<pre name=\"13be\" id=\"13be\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">tee := io.TeeReader(c.Conn, c.buf)\nn, err = tee.Read(b) // standard lib does the dangerous stuff!\nif err != nil {\n    return\n}\nif c.buf.Len() < 5 {\n    return\n}</pre>\n<p>Above, we check that we have 5 bytes for the header. Once we have that, we’ll inspect it to get the length of the ClientHello. We’ll make sure the length is a reasonable value and then read the rest of the ClientHello using the same kind of code, which I’ll skip here for brevity, but you can <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/mholt/caddy@f49e0c9b560ea7efc25c0b15d422b59f42a6edb1/-/blob/caddyhttp/httpserver/mitm.go#L122:1-132:1\">read it at the source</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Parsing-the-ClientHello-Manually\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Parsing-the-ClientHello-Manually\" aria-label=\"Parsing the ClientHello Manually permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Parsing the ClientHello Manually</h4>\n<p>I <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/mholt/caddy@0a0d2cc1cf12d58c5e38680689c78f18044288e6/-/blob/caddyhttp/httpserver/mitm.go#L162:1-163:1\">borrowed</a> (with credit) <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/golang/go@32b41c8dc75a731e4053b59b19c542a79eb56c1f/-/blob/src/crypto/tls/handshake_messages.go#L300:1-301:1\">some code</a> from the standard library to parse the ClientHello record.

The most conventional way of doing this is writing an HTTP middleware with a reference to our <code class=\"language-text\">tlsHelloListener</code>:</p>\n<pre name=\"ff9b\" id=\"ff9b\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">type tlsHandler struct {\n    next     http.Handler\n    listener *tlsHelloListener\n}</pre>\n<p>Its <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/mholt/caddy@f49e0c9b560ea7efc25c0b15d422b59f42a6edb1/-/blob/caddyhttp/httpserver/mitm.go#L36:1-37:1\"><strong>ServeHTTP()</strong></a> method looks something like this:</p>\n<pre name=\"2ea2\" id=\"2ea2\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">func (h *tlsHandler) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    if h.listener == nil {\n        h.next.ServeHTTP(w, r)\n        return\n    }</pre>\n<pre name=\"6c1e\" id=\"6c1e\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\">    h.listener.helloInfosMu.RLock()\n    info := h.listener.helloInfos[r.RemoteAddr]\n    h.listener.helloInfosMu.RUnlock()\n\n    // (do things, then call next.ServeHTTP)\n}</pre>\n<p>The locking is unfortunate, but load tests with <strong>wrk</strong> indicated no noticeable performance degradation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Conclusion\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Conclusion\" aria-label=\"Conclusion permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Phew! I hope you enjoyed this. But I’ll bet I had more fun coding it up than you did reading this. (<a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/mholt/caddy/-/blob/caddyhttp/httpserver/mitm.go\">The proof is in the code!</a>)</p>\n<p>Is this solution perfect? Nope, it does involve a slight bit of buffering and locking (again, nothing too bad), and my implementation may still have flaws (bug reports welcome) — but thanks to Go’s design and use of interfaces, this task wasn’t painful. You just have to be creative without being too clever!</p>\n<p><em>You can try Caddy’s MITM detection feature now by building</em> <a href=\"https://github.com/mholt/caddy\"><em>Caddy</em></a> <em>from source using Go 1.8.
