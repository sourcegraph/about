Marcel, Paul said, has a deep background in configuration management, having been part of the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2015/04/borg-predecessor-to-kubernetes/\">initial Borg team</a> (Borg is a spiritual predecessor to Kubernetes).</p>\n<p>CUE solves a number of pain points, such as dealing with white space in YAML or configuration templating. “If you ever find yourself fighting with white space in YAML,” Paul said, “that is an area that CUE can solve.” Essentially, CUE is trying to solve the problem of configurations at scale. Considering how often non-engineers are in charge of maintaining configuration, Paul explained, CUE is also designed to be approachable and accessible.</p>\n<p>The end result is the ability to have a “unified view of your configuration across many different systems, as opposed to different configurations and different tooling for different parts of whatever your system may be.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"What-can-CUE-do\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#What-can-CUE-do\" aria-label=\"What can CUE do permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>What can CUE do?</h3>\n<p>In one example, Paul showed how, with CUE, you can have data and schema sitting alongside each other. CUE can translate between different formats and create a single source of truth that works nicely: “All of your tooling can then hang off that,” Paul said.</p>\n<p>In another example, Paul used CUE to validate a YAML file to ensure it obeys the schema. Validation is powerful when you’re trying to “move as early as possible into your configuration pipeline,” he explained. Instead of leaving configuration to the last minute or trying to quickly work it out when your configuration fails, CUE enables you to figure it out early.</p>\n<p>In a third example, Paul used the <a href=\"https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph\">Sourcegraph deploy repo</a> to show a base directory of the YAML specification of all the Kubernetes objects. Paul noted the different services that form part of the Sourcegraph configuration, explaining how maintaining all the regularity between different services and objects can become a headache. Paul showed how you can use CUE to “view things as a unified configuration.” With CUE, Paul was able to remove boilerplate and move things that are common between configurations to the top.</p>\n<p>By the end of his CUE tour, Paul said “We’ve barely scratched the surface.” He pointed viewers toward the <a href=\"https://github.com/cuelang/cue\">CUE repository</a> to learn more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Watch-Paul-explain-CUE\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Watch-Paul-explain-CUE\" aria-label=\"Watch Paul explain CUE permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Watch Paul explain CUE</h2>\n<p>Check out the recording of the CUE tour below, and be sure to <a href=\"https://info.sourcegraph.com/dev-tool-time\">sign up for upcoming events</a>!</p>\n<div class=\"container my-4 video-embed embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mU-lEszuht0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>"}
