You can use operators such as <strong>repo:</strong> and <strong>file:</strong> to restrict your search to certain repositories and files (by regular expression match on their name).</p>\n<p>For example, <strong>repo:foo</strong> will restrict your query to repositories whose name contains “foo,” and likewise for <strong>file:bar</strong>.</p>\n<p>Search scopes make it easier to quickly search only among the code you care about, such as all JavaScript files or only non-vendored code.</p>\n<div>\n    <img class=\"pa1 ba b--light-7\" src=\"//images.contentful.com/le3mxztn6yoo/Fko76K31Ic6q0KC8IKEue/7e0dff2bb462e5cc4d60d1e5a3a3505d/search-demo.gif\" alt=\"Search scopes demo, a more powerful code search on Sourcegraph\">\n</div>\n<p>Try it out at <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/search\">sourcegraph.com/search</a> or on a <a href=\"https://docs.sourcegraph.com/#quickstart\">self-hosted Sourcegraph instance</a> now.</p>\n<p>Use the search fields on the homepage to construct your query the first few times.</p>\n<p>As you continue using it, you can express your query more quickly by using the operators (<strong>repo:</strong> and <strong>file:</strong>, etc.) in the main search box. Here are some sample queries (across a sample set of open source projects) to get you started:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Search non-vendored files for “open file”: <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=open+file&#x26;sq=repogroup:sample+-file:vendor/+-file:node_modules/\"><strong>repogroup:sample -file:vendor/ -file:node_modules/ open file</strong></a></li>\n<li>Search repositories named “mux” in test files for “new route”: <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=repo:mux+new+route&#x26;sq=repogroup:sample+file:%28test%7Cspec%29\"><strong>repogroup:sample file:(test|spec) repo:mux new route</strong></a></li>\n<li>Search for occurrences of “partial&#x3C;” in TypeScript files: <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=file:%5C.ts+partial%3C&#x26;sq=repogroup:sample\"><strong>repogroup:sample file:.ts$ partial&#x3C;</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let us know what you think on Twitter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/sourcegraph\">@sourcegraph</a>). To get advanced code search for your company’s code, <a href=\"https://docs.sourcegraph.com\">install Sourcegraph</a>.</p>\n<p>p.s. One other minor improvement: You can now select multiple lines (and share a link to multiple lines) by shift-clicking on a line number to expand the selection when you’re viewing a code file.</p>"}
