Now I can actually build and start building pages.” And so, this is how I really… the first iteration. But the places where I really started was with video games.

You’re just basically building a map. And once, at some point I was able to get to know this, some people realized that actually in practice, all of these things that you would double-click and change on the screen would actually generate a programming language and real code. And so this was super interesting because now I was able to implement, get rid of all of the UI and just write code.

And then this way, for live competition kind of thing, now everybody’s running the same thing and they’re able to figure things out. So one of the very interesting things is you’re not able to allocate any memory. And so now if you’re working on JavaScript, anytime you do var X equal an object, you’re basically allocating your memory.

And my major was actually in computer vision and artificial intelligence. And I actually had the choice to go with more web development, but I felt like I already knew that and if I didn’t know already those things now, I could learn them on the job.

And then you’re able to find all of the edges, you’re able to find all of the areas in the image and those kind of things. And so this was one technique. And the other one that I’ve learned through this is a neural network. And so as you mentioned, neural network were really big in the 70s, the 80s, or something like this. And then there was the AI Winter and basically people didn’t find any concrete use cases.

So no data is going through the server and everything. But a lot of the company, and rightly so, are afraid of using it for their core business if there’s no one behind it, another legal entity behind and those kinds of things.

And then of course this requires investment. So they have to pay right now it’s $7 a month per seat to do it. And now it’s Milos and David and I want to make a living out of this.

Whereas if there’s a problem and the problem is big enough, then it’s going to get staffed.
