I mean, sometimes it’s once you hit a certain scale, it doesn’t even make sense to try and keep up with the change as well.

I need to apply those methods and use those tools to get across those quickly”.

You can do the general development environment, that’s probably not going to change drastically, but then for the newer parts of the code base, is it worth investing in any sort of process there at all?

You can have kind of a state where you have multiple mono repos and have multiple monolists as a company. Some things are shared libraries, this and that.

And a thing that we have that’s really cool is an internal service catalog, and I’d actually built or prototype, I would say a similar tool at Cloudflare and companies have talked about this kind of Spotify open source their backstage tool, which is backstage.io.

I don’t know if it’s imposter syndrome, but you feel like you’re being judged at a scale that you hadn’t been judged before, right? And you’re kind of working with a large number of people. And maybe that was just the particular culture of the place that I was at the time.
