This requires re-indexing the database when upgrading to 3.31, which can take up to a few hours on systems with large datasets. <a href=\"https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/migration/3_31\">Read more on how to prepare for the update here</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Saved-search-notifications-are-migrating-to-code-monitoring\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Saved-search-notifications-are-migrating-to-code-monitoring\" aria-label=\"Saved search notifications are migrating to code monitoring permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Saved search notifications are migrating to code monitoring</h2>\n<p>Email notifications for saved searches are being deprecated in favor of code monitoring notifications. Similar to email notifications for saved searches, code monitoring allows you to keep track of and get notified about changes in your code. Some use cases for code monitors include getting notifications for potential secrets, anti-patterns, or common typos committed to your codebase. Read more about <a href=\"https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_monitoring\">code monitoring</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are using email notifications for existing saved searches, there is now a button to automatically migrate to code monitoring. Note that existing email notifications for saved searches will be removed in the future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Were-working-to-index-the-open-source-universe-on-Sourcegraph-cloud\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Were-working-to-index-the-open-source-universe-on-Sourcegraph-cloud\" aria-label=\"Were working to index the open source universe on Sourcegraph cloud permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>We’re working to index the open source universe on Sourcegraph cloud</h2>\n<p>Sourcegraph is working to index every open source GitHub and GitLab repository with 1 or more stars.
