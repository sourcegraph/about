The one actually… Just one of the interesting things when you add types to a language is that it turns out you really end up wanting to also add something like classes at the same time. And that’s because when you add types, but if you don’t have classes, you kind of have to say everything twice. You have to describe the interface for the class-like thing in one place, and then you have to describe the constructor for the class-like thing in another place, and the methods and everything. And so it’s sort of like you have to describe the interface and the implementation independently.","position":{"start":{"line":348,"column":10,"offset":40424},"end":{"line":349,"column":647,"offset":41071},"indent":[1]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":348,"column":1,"offset":40415},"end":{"line":349,"column":647,"offset":41071},"indent":[1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"strong","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Luke:","position":{"start":{"line":351,"column":3,"offset":41075},"end":{"line":351,"column":8,"offset":41080},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":351,"column":1,"offset":41073},"end":{"line":351,"column":10,"offset":41082},"indent":[]}},{"type":"text","value":"\nAnd so one of the things people love with classes is they give you kind of an easy way to describe both the interface and the implementation together in a very succinct way.
