Our responsibility was to build and maintain the infrastructure of the Sourcegraph application for other teams. Some of our previous work includes licensing enforcement, background permissions syncing, and explicit permissions APIs.</p>\n<p>In April of 2020, we decided to tackle integration testing. Although integration testing wasn’t something any single team could own, it involved code-based infrastructure and naturally fell on the Core Application team.</p>\n<p>The goal was to remove all existing backend-related end-to-end tests and reliably run their corresponding unit and/or integration tests as part of our CI pipeline on all branches––the end result being a more reliable, less flaky testing suite.</p>\n<p>Integration testing isn’t glamorous work, but it’s necessary and, most importantly, impactful. Inspired by a previous post, <a href=\"https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/how-not-to-break-a-search-engine-unglamorous-engineering/\">How not to break a search engine or: What I learned about unglamorous engineering</a>, I wanted to share another piece of unglamorous engineering that, despite its lack of glamor, made a big impact.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Before-backend-integration-testing\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Before-backend-integration-testing\" aria-label=\"Before backend integration testing permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Before backend integration testing</h2>\n<p>Our work started with an <a href=\"https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/company-info-and-process/communication/rfcs\">RFC</a> (Request For Comment) that you can see <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LfCDPZZAkP4gFB0no-0Hb90EqMItnzv3YEb07B7WtrM/edit#heading=h.trqab8y0kufp\">on our public RFCs folder</a>.</p>\n<p>Before having the backend integration testing, we were relying entirely on end-to-end tests written in JavaScript. These tests would boot up a virtual browser, move the cursor, and click buttons to simulate a real user using the Sourcegraph application.</p>\n<p>The problem with this approach is that it’s not always stable and it’s easy to either time out or miss the button. The CI pipeline ends up becoming undependable, incurring a loss of trust in the end-to-end tests. Instead, we wanted to remove the browser manipulation layer and hit the APIs directly for most parts of the tests in the end-to-end test suite.</p>\n<p>Instead of booting up a virtual browser, moving the cursor around and clicking buttons that are hard to predict when will be available, our backend intergration testing gets rid of the UI and hits the same GraphQL API endpoints that our web app would. Integration tests pretend our client is the browser and the user, and do all the steps necessary to simulate what a user does. They can then verify that a function is working as expected.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Discovery-process\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Discovery-process\" aria-label=\"Discovery process permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Discovery process</h2>\n<p>Work like this is too complex to simply assign to an engineer and ask them to handle it.</p>\n<p>We need to do discovery and lay out the steps, as well as try to estimate the amount of effort it will likely take. We also need to propose a solution, ask people to review the proposal, and incorporate their feedback.</p>\n<p>We learned in this process, for instance, that if we aren’t running tests against a live Sourcegraph instance, then those search tests won’t be valuable. Those search tests will be a waste of CPU and a waste of machine power. That realization led us to booting up a live Sourcegraph machine that we could use for testing and cloning.

We reused the Go test infrastructure (<code class=\"language-text\">go test</code>), so engineers can write regular Go tests, and run these tests as integration tests. All the pre-steps and clean-up steps are done, then anyone can fill in all the tests that bring value to the codebase.</p>\n<p>As a result, the Search team are currently using the backend integration testing to validate and/or add new tests to the test suite.

Otherwise, it’s easy to misunderstand the purposes of each test.</li>\n<li><strong>Decouple the tests</strong>: Decouple the setup and teardown process of each test. The goal of doing so is to avoid cases where tests pass because of side effects. If some tests pass only because of side effects, then they could cause some huge headaches when they don’t work.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The migration process is as much about shared consensus as sheer migration. Make sure we understand what the purpose of each test is and check that we’re avoiding unintentionally passing a test that won’t work independently.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Stage-four-Remove-migrated-tests-from-the-end-to-end-test-suite\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Stage-four-Remove-migrated-tests-from-the-end-to-end-test-suite\" aria-label=\"Stage four Remove migrated tests from the end to end test suite permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Stage four: Remove migrated tests from the end-to-end test suite</h3>\n<p>Remove the corresponding unit tests or backend integration tests from the end-to-end test suite–but only when we’ve first proven them to be working and stable.

Simplicity</h3>\n<p>Our primary goal during this project, and beyond, was to provide integration testing as a service to Sourcegraph users as well as team members within Sourcegraph.</p>\n<p>Ideally, integration tests should be easy to maintain and easy to extend. Our integration tests are sophisticated, homemade integration test suites. Our team has to take the time to learn how to add new tests, how to fix broken tests, and more.</p>\n<p>But doing so should be as familiar as writing any other Go code.

Invisibility</h3>\n<p>Integration testing, and all the work that went into it, should be invisible to people most of the time. Integration testing should just work.

It’s especially hard to do so in a CI environment.</p>\n<p>Integration testing is a major step toward better reliability and one that teams and users at Sourcegraph will benefit from for a long time.
