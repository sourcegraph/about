Coobernetti’s Yamhill’s and Docker builds and the port forwards you want, it might be because your dev isn’t in Coobernetti’s that it’s, uh, this process to run, uh, to compile and this other process to run, to run the service for each of your.

One was about, uh, Developer tools and there were a bunch.\nAnd at that time, Google was realizing we need to actually vest in these things that are crucial to engineering to actually staff them up with full time engineers as the org was growing.\nAnd so I was working on developer tools and I’ll be honest, there was. A cost to that of not working on production systems full time means that you lose some of what the means our day to day. You get this kind of stilted view. I think that notion of there’s your work doing app dev. Where your, uh, actually program, what your users use that run in the data center versus being developer experience engineer, where you’re working on the developer experience that every other developer has on their laptop.\nAt the time desktop, uh, it was, it’s really key to invest in as well at a certain size. Um, it was amazing to see how quickly things were growing. It wasn’t enough just to make, you know, the build tool faster, uh, when. The whole code base was crowing so quickly that you had to not just make it faster at the rate that the code base was growing, but even faster than that in order to actually have users see an improvement.\nSo it was stressful, but, uh, exciting.

I did it in parallel across a bunch of computers in the data center and it would take 40 minutes and that was. Technically super impressive.

I think the conflict is that we say we want to help move your development to the cloud. And we aren’t starting with an IDE. And why is that? And I think it’s cause to us, there’s. The text that you edit and how do you edit that? We worked on Google sheets and Google docs.\nAnd so we kind of know what it’s like to build an editor, uh, in web technologies. We instead started not with the text that you’re editing. But the workflows, once you have, you know, bytes saved in some file system on disc, what do you actually want to do with that? How do you mean no, that they’re the right words in some programming language.\nWe think that unlike with, uh, Documents like Google docs, it’s way less, uh, in that inner loop about what do other people think, which is what web collaboration makes easy and way more about what are the workflows. And so till we. Uh, want you to be able to use it and to use that, to standardize your developer environment, whether you run it, um, on your laptop, talking to a cloud cluster on your laptop, talking to a cluster like mini cube, or like we said, the foreman, whether you’re running it.\nUm, in a cloud VM talking to a cloud cluster, there are all of these kinds of things. Uh, and I think almost a de lamination occurring between web IDs, between all IDs, really, and how they, uh, effect with an E how they. How they operate is maybe less ambiguous the workflows that you want to do. You’re seeing with language server protocol, the IDE, he knows less about the language, uh, because it’s farming that out to this language server.\nI think more of that has to happen with IDs saying, Hey, it’s not about running this one, binary or debugging, this one binary. Um, it’s about what are the different workflows and what’s the menu that’s available. And we kind of think that kilts a great compliment to that and that, uh, I don’t know. I think about Gmail, Gmail really changed what, what mail was like, but, you know, nowadays, most people access Gmail through mobile apps.\nSo how often do you really use the fact that you can get it from anywhere? And so like, what’s. What ends up being, you know, the key part of an idea or a change, um, can reveal itself differently 10 years later. So I think that what’s important. He is less the, you know, I believe that Pete, we’re going to figure out how to edit in a browser and it’s more, once you’ve edited in the browser.\nHow do you know that’s right. And I think the answer isn’t just, cause that’s too slow, you know, YouTube has for years had this, you can go in and proposed small edits just in the web, but it’s really, how do you make that fluent? And I think that the answer isn’t. Going to be just, I happened to have a shell in some cloud VM, because you still have so much to get up to speed with, to actually do interesting things, like start your app, or we see the database.\nAnd so we want to fit into that. Tilt, because we think that otherwise it’s just a bunch of, uh, using Wiki pages to know which shelf scripts to invoke with which arcs. We want to be a workflow in that teams find so useful that it’s the obvious answer for how to help new contributors and what kind of stuff.\nSee what the popular UI is, are to make the. Edits to the text, which is a huge problem. And which I think is why you’re kind of seeing this separation between the IDE what’s the Chrome of it.

So AWS Lambda, uh, Google cloud functions, CloudFlare workers, and, um, a bunch of other, um, Uh, infrastructure providers are now offering people the ability to run code, uh, with minimal deployment configuration.\nUm, first of all, you know, do you, you see that becoming a, a big thing in terms of how people deploy software and if so, how does tilt fit into that picture?","position":{"start":{"line":332,"column":12,"offset":53031},"end":{"line":333,"column":160,"offset":53529},"indent":[1]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":332,"column":1,"offset":53020},"end":{"line":333,"column":160,"offset":53529},"indent":[1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"strong","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Dan:","position":{"start":{"line":335,"column":3,"offset":53533},"end":{"line":335,"column":7,"offset":53537},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":335,"column":1,"offset":53531},"end":{"line":335,"column":9,"offset":53539},"indent":[]}},{"type":"text","value":" Yeah, I think it’s definitely becoming a big thing. The question is, does big mean a 0.1%, which already is huge or one or 10 or 50 or 90 or 99.9. Right. Um, I think that, uh, really tilt. Uh, about being an engine that understands distributed systems and giving you a holistic view of it with the UI. Uh, You definitely want it in a situation with server lists, where there are more pieces to think about where, you know, changing one thing, there’s more nooks and crannies that can go wrong.\nIf anything, it makes our job. Uh, more essential and harder as you actually, you know, think about, I’m not just changing this one, function, my credit app to save it, but what actually happens when I save it and then my next serverless function reads that value. When there’s problems across that, how do you deal with it?\nI think, uh, people don’t know what’s going to happen with Coobernetti’s. Um, will people use Coobernetti’s will they use their company’s layer atop Coobernetti’s will they all use one common layer on top of Kubernetes and, uh, I think that’s a really interesting question that I don’t know.\nAnd almost like with tilt what’s important to us is that we’re, um, you know, Help writing the freak Treme of Coobernetti’s not trying to lay track in front of it, right. That we’re not trying to do something that Coobernetti’s could. And, uh, I think, uh, thankfully for us, the Kubernetes project is kind of clear about what the sounds are serverless.\nWhat do you want? Difficult to figure out, I think of get, get has this idea of plumbing versus porcelain that you could put different UIs and by you, or I might mean a command line interface, but with different, you know, verbs and, uh, on top of the get, um, internals and none of those have taken off. Like, there’s just something about, uh, having some interface and having it be common that makes it hard to build something on top of it.\nI think of worst is better. Um, this amazing paper by Richard Gabriel, uh, about how kind of C and C plus plus and Unix are good enough. And he was this old common lisp packer. Uh, Emacs, uh, person, uh, to call back to our shared, uh, love apparently. And he’s kind of the moaning, like why aren’t people rebelling that all they have is C and Unix and he gets at like, kind of what makes it such an effective virus to spread and be impossible to replace because it’s wormed its way in.\nI don’t know. And I think I’m kind of hedging my bets by trying to be in places where that doesn’t matter, no matter what you use to deploy, you’re going to have to think about the different functions you’re writing, whether they’re one binary or 10 or 1500 to figure out what the overall app is. That’s what.\nThat’s what I believe. That’s all I have to believe to make something that really helps a bunch of people. And so what you’re asking is kind of a over the horizon for me, which might make me a less interesting podcast guest, but I hope makes me a more effective, uh, tool Smith.","position":{"start":{"line":335,"column":9,"offset":53539},"end":{"line":342,"column":279,"offset":56523},"indent":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":335,"column":1,"offset":53531},"end":{"line":342,"column":279,"offset":56523},"indent":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"strong","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Beyang:","position":{"start":{"line":344,"column":3,"offset":56527},"end":{"line":344,"column":10,"offset":56534},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":344,"column":1,"offset":56525},"end":{"line":344,"column":12,"offset":56536},"indent":[]}},{"type":"text","value":" No, I think it makes a lot of sense.
