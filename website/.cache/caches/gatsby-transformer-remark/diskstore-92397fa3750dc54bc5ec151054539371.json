That’s why we’re building Sourcegraph.</p>\n<p><strong>If you want a better way to discover and understand code, we invite you to</strong> <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/\"><strong>start using Sourcegraph today.</strong></a> It’s free for public and private code, it’s integrated with GitHub, and you can start using it immediately.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Already, Sourcegraph is helping developers at startups and large organizations discover and understand code better. In the coming months, we’re excited to share these teams’ stories about how Sourcegraph helps them build better software. These folks tell us they chose Sourcegraph for the following reasons:</p>\n<p><strong>With Code Intelligence, Sourcegraph actually understands your code.</strong> Your code comes alive when you can browse like an IDE, easily jumping to definitions and viewing docs and type information. It’s hard to go back to browsing code elsewhere once you’ve experienced this. (Note: It’s currently for Go and Java only; more languages coming soon.)</p>\n<img src=\"//images.contentful.com/le3mxztn6yoo/4vQQGPlrpSKIayi2A8SUCI/2c486b9b5be796b1e203ece2cf0e1096/1_RzHYLrAIuhh8p4xOVnjoSQ.png\" alt=\"1*RzHYLrAIuhh8p4xOVnjoSQ\">\n<p><a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/golang/go/-/def/GoPackage/fmt/-/Fprintf\">On Sourcegraph, everything in code is clickable (jump-to-def) and has doc tooltips. You can understand code more quickly with these.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Live usage examples save time and encourage best practices.</strong> With Sourcegraph, you’ll instantly see how any function, class, type, etc., is used across all of your company’s private code and/or open source code. As a wise developer once said, “The right example is worth a thousand words of documentation.”</p>\n<img src=\"//images.contentful.com/le3mxztn6yoo/X7Su8GvcsuyY2IiOsOYGS/ab96b46d609614acadf94e8fd9718a29/1_e2ecNFlkz80d0tjK2rgpzw.png\" alt=\"1*e2ecNFlkz80d0tjK2rgpzw\">\n<p><a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/golang/go/-/info/GoPackage/fmt/-/Fprintf\">At the time this post was published, Fprintf was called in more than 11,000 other projects around the world.
