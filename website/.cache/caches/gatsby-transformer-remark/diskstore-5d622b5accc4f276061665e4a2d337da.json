But ex-Googlers prefer Gerrit, and ex-Facebookers prefer Phabricator.</li>\n<li>Code reviewers looked primarily for general “code smell”, sloppy spacing, incorrect semicolon usage, and other visual cues. These signal sloppiness and that the code should be reviewed more scrupulously.</li>\n<li>Most engineers assume tests have been run on the code before asking for a code review.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"Team-size-tooling-and-culture-affects-everything\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Team-size-tooling-and-culture-affects-everything\" aria-label=\"Team size tooling and culture affects everything permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Team size, tooling, and culture affects everything</h3>\n<p>Key takeaway: as engineering teams scale, the code review process gets more involved and less nimble due to the limitations of current code review tools.</p>\n<p>Key insights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Small teams (1–10) use pair-programming as a way of ensuring good quality code.</li>\n<li>Medium teams (10–20) encounter bottlenecks with multiple repositories, communication of feedback, and waiting on code review from teammates. They experience challenges when onboarding new developers related to inconsistencies in code patterns and styles.</li>\n<li>Larger teams (20–30+) tend to have a more formal process. Many consolidate code into one large repository. They have defined team roles for code review and reporting.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"The-ideal-code-review-tool\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#The-ideal-code-review-tool\" aria-label=\"The ideal code review tool permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>The ideal code review tool</h3>\n<p>Key takeaway: the next evolution of code review tools should include more automated features that work at scale across different teams.</p>\n<p>We asked each person to share what their “ideal code review tool” might look like. Here’s what we heard.</p>\n<p>Key insights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Linting: Almost all of the teams brought up the value of linting running automatically on pull requests, but none of the teams had set up a linting service.</li>\n<li>Code and comment history: Have you ever commented on a pull request, only to lose the entire set of comments and code history after a force push? The ideal code review tool would give developers access to this archived history quickly and easily to help provide more context for future code reviews.</li>\n<li>The social side of code review: Code review comments are one of the main emotional outlets of writing code. The frustration, the pain, and the excitement of pushing new code comes across in discussion comments. The ideal code review tool would recognize the human side of the process, so even the most banal pull request can be enjoyable.</li>\n</ul>"}
