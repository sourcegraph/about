This was incompatible with having tight repository access control, and was impractical at a large scale. We heard from customers that they wanted all users to be able to create batch changes on all repositories, without them needing overly broad write permissions.</p>\n<p>That’s why we are introducing <a href=\"https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/config/batch_changes#forks\">Batch Changes on forks</a>, which makes it possible for branches created by Batch Changes to be pushed to a fork of the repository rather than the repository itself. This solves those access control challenges and lets you safely enable Batch Changes for everyone. In Sourcegraph 3.36, this is an instance setting that can be turned either on or off for all users, and is off by default.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Find-repo-files-faster-with-fuzzy-finder\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Find-repo-files-faster-with-fuzzy-finder\" aria-label=\"Find repo files faster with fuzzy finder permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Find repo files faster with fuzzy finder</h2>\n<p>We’re excited to introduce a new fuzzy file finder which can help you quickly open a file from your repository. The keyboard shortcut to activate it is Cmd+K on macOS, or Ctrl+K on Linux/Windows. Note that it will only activate when you’re on repository-related pages, such as the repository overview page for example.</p>\n<video class=\"blog-image\" title=\"Fuzzy finder\" alt=\"An example of using fuzzy finder to navigate to test files within the sourcegraph/sourcegraph repo.\" loop autoplay muted playsinline>\n  <source src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/blog/3.36/fuzzy-file-finder.webm\" type=\"video/webm\" data-cookieconsent=\"ignore\">\n  <source src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/blog/3.36/fuzzy-file-finder.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" data-cookieconsent=\"ignore\">\n</video>\n<h2 id=\"Document-your-code-searches-with-Notebooks\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Document-your-code-searches-with-Notebooks\" aria-label=\"Document your code searches with Notebooks permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Document your code searches with Notebooks</h2>\n<p>We’re excited to announce that <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/notebooks\">Notebooks</a> have progressed from Experimental to Beta! Notebooks are a great way to document code and codebases to onboard new team members, keep track of bug resolutions, or record search examples to share with teammates. Recently, we published a public <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/notebooks/Tm90ZWJvb2s6MQ==\">Notebook</a> to identify <a href=\"https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/log4j-log4shell-0-day/\">log4j dependencies</a>. Notebooks are shareable, and you can star ones you find useful to keep track of them or to help others find useful Notebooks.</p>\n<p>To try them out, make sure Notebooks are enabled in your settings by setting <code class=\"language-text\">showSearchNotebook</code> to <code class=\"language-text\">true</code> under the <code class=\"language-text\">experimentalFeatures</code> property. Once you have Notebooks enabled, go ahead and <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/notebooks?tab=explore\">explore some public Notebooks</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Scope-searches-on-monorepos-and-large-codebases-with-query-based-search-contexts\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Scope-searches-on-monorepos-and-large-codebases-with-query-based-search-contexts\" aria-label=\"Scope searches on monorepos and large codebases with query based search contexts permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Scope searches on monorepos and large codebases with query-based search contexts</h2>\n<p>Search contexts can now be defined with a restricted search query as an alternative to a specific list of repositories and revisions; a new feature we’re launching in Beta.</p>\n<p>What does this mean for users? First, this provides search context support for monorepos. Second, and just as impactful, users with thousands of repositories and different teams or sub-organizations can easily define dynamic search contexts with a query. No more specifying dozens or hundreds of repositories and keeping the list up to date.</p>\n<p>You can also now create new search contexts right from the search results page. Once you’ve enabled query-based search contexts, you can run a search and click the “Create context” button to turn that query into a search context. Check the <a href=\"https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search/how-to/search_contexts#beta-query-based-search-contexts\">search contexts docs</a> to learn more about how to enable and use query-based search contexts.</p>"}
