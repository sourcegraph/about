Today, Sourcegraph provides basic code intelligence for many languages <a href=\"https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_intelligence/basic_code_intelligence\">using our search engine</a>. It’s fast, requires zero configuration, and covers many use cases, but the results are not guaranteed to be completely accurate.  To get more precise answers we also use language-specific indexers to generate data in <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2019/02/19/lsif\">Language Server Index Format</a> (LSIF), for important navigation queries like Go-to-Definition and Find References. Indexers already exist for several languages, including C++, Go, TypeScript, and Dart, and more are in-progress (visit <a href=\"https://lsif.dev\">https://lsif.dev</a> for a list of indexers).</p>\n<p>For historical reasons, we also run separate language servers for Go and TypeScript code. As part of our indexing work, we’ve changed the default settings on Sourcegraph.com to use <em>only</em> LSIF or basic code intelligence for those languages. Repositories that don’t contain Go or TypeScript are completely unaffected by this. For repositories that <em>do</em> contain Go or TypeScript code, it’s easy to set up indexing. If you’re interested, check out our <a href=\"https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_intelligence/lsif_quickstart\">LSIF Quick Start guide</a>, and the README files for <a href=\"https://github.com/sourcegraph/lsif-go\">the Go indexer</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/sourcegraph/lsif-node\">the TypeScript indexer</a>.</p>\n<p>We don’t expect this change to have a big impact on your use of Sourcegraph. If for some reason you do run into problems, however, please <a href=\"https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/new?assignees=&#x26;labels=&#x26;template=question.md&#x26;title=\">file an issue to let us know</a>! We would like to understand and help you fix or work around any issues you may encounter.</p>"}
