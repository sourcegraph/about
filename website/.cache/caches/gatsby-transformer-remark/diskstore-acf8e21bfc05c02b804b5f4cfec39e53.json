So, your request enters the system, maybe hits the API server. That’s one blob and maybe it bounces off to hit the payment service, that’s another blob. When the request enters a service, like we initialized an empty honeycomb blob, and then we pre-populate it with everything that we know or confer about the system, the language internals, the parameters or past it, all the basics. And then while it’s executing in your service, you can effectively do a print F, just print any details that you want into it.","position":{"start":{"line":215,"column":13,"offset":24586},"end":{"line":216,"column":685,"offset":25271}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":215,"column":1,"offset":24574},"end":{"line":216,"column":685,"offset":25271}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Charity:","position":{"start":{"line":218,"column":3,"offset":25275},"end":{"line":218,"column":11,"offset":25283}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":218,"column":1,"offset":25273},"end":{"line":218,"column":13,"offset":25285}}},{"type":"text","value":"\nWhat you want to capture is any unique IDs, anything where you’re like, “Oh yeah, somebody’s going to file a bug someday and I’m going to want to be able to find it by this.” Right?
