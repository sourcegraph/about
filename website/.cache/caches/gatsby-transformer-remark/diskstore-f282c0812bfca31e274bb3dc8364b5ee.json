Setting up the environment again (if she gets a new laptop, for example) can also be done with ease. Having all her data in the cloud also allows her to keep her two MacBooks in sync with each other.</p>\n<h2 id=\"GitHub\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#GitHub\" aria-label=\"GitHub permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a><a href=\"https://github.com\">GitHub</a></h2>\n<p>Leah’s fondness of keeping all her data in the cloud also applies to her Git version control and coding projects, which she keeps in GitHub. She also prefers GitHub for project management, viewing it as a method of communication:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I don’t believe things like Slack or email are the best place to have conversations about work, but using a tool that everyone can access—it’s more permanent.

She likes using a GUI over the command line as it lets her preview what she’s doing clearly before committing. For example, you can see the changes as they would appear in a pull request, which makes self-reviewing (which Leah values highly) much more pleasant.</p>\n<p>Slightly more complex Git functionalities, such as cherry picking into other branches, can be easily accomplished through drag and drop.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Dropbox-Paper\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Dropbox-Paper\" aria-label=\"Dropbox Paper permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/paper\">Dropbox Paper</a></h2>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">“If you’re still using Google docs, what are you doing!” 😂Questioning everything as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/leahculver?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@leahculver</a> walks us through her workflow and favorite tools. <a href=\"https://t.co/1kYLl1QfZU\">https://t.co/1kYLl1QfZU</a></p>&mdash; Kacie (@mskaciej) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mskaciej/status/1387471457018515458?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 28, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Leah loves the simplicity of Dropbox Paper for taking notes and appreciates how easy it is to include Markdown as well as the fun features like adding emoji.

It also makes it easier to entrust someone to take care of all your accounts via the master password if you were to pass away. While this is something most people don’t like to think about, it’s important to keep this in mind and be prepared.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Xcode\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Xcode\" aria-label=\"Xcode permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/xcode/\">Xcode</a></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“It’s just straight-up Xcode—I don’t even change the colors or anything, I’m really boring.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Leah’s one trick for Xcode is to use presentation mode (Preferences>Themes>Presentation) for a larger view.

She checks her email several times a day, and says the key is to handle things quickly as they come in, using her system:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spam -> archive or unsubscribe</li>\n<li>Newsletters -> skim quickly and archive</li>\n<li>Notifications -> configure the tool to send only the notifications she wants to see, rather than filtering them</li>\n<li>Emails that actually need attention -> deal with it right away, if possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If something requires a lengthy response, she will often ask to follow up on a call instead.</p>\n<p>One thing Superhuman does really well is to show you the context and profile for anyone in your inbox: your email history with that person, plus links to their social presence (even including recent tweets!)</p>\n<p>There are also features like labels and snooze to help locate and surface messages later.
