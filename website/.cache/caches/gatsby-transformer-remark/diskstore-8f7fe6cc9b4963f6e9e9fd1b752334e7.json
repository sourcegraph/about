right. Hey, everyone. Welcome back to another episode of the Sourcegraph podcast. So a couple months back, I started noticing my teammate, Stephen, tweeting about this thing called Zig. And at first I didn’t make much of it, because Stephen is a brilliant programmer who has built a lot of the core functionality up and down the stack at Sourcegraph, who also likes to pursue a lot of side projects, ranging from hacking on search backends and indexing technology to building miniature castles for his many, many cats at his home. But then he kept tweeting about this and all the cool stuff that he is building in Zig. And so I decided to take a closer look, and upon taking that closer look, I found a really cool programming language that was new to me, and a really awesome early community around it. And Zig is this systems programming language intended to replace C, and I’m really glad today to be joined by Stephen, and also the creator of the Zig programming language and the founder and president of the Zig software foundation, Andrew Kelley.

And it’s just an invitation to just drag something onto the form and just create something. So I really enjoyed playing with Visual Basic and I just tackled everything I could think of. I wanted to make a WYSIWYG website editor. I wanted to make games. I wanted to make utilities. I wanted to make macros to move the mouse and click for you.

People think that Zig doesn’t care about safety. But there’s so much work in the language that goes into safety. It’s just everywhere. When you do pointer alignment checks, and if you do an alignment cast, that’s safety checked.

All the safety features are still activated for me. Even though I’m doing unsafe things, it’s not black and white. Zig makes unsafe code safer.
