There’s been some interesting <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8046710\">discussion</a> about <a href=\"http://andrew.yurisich.com/work/2014/07/16/dont-link-that-line-number/\">the right way</a>, and it’s something we think about a lot at <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com\">Sourcegraph</a> as we build a better way for developers to discover and understand code.</p>\n<p>The consensus is that when you’re linking to a file, you should refer to a specific commit ID, not a branch or tag, so that the link works even if the file’s lines change. (On GitHub and <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/golang/go/-/def/GoPackage/fmt/-/Fprintf\">Sourcegraph</a>, you can change the URL to refer to an absolute commit ID by pressing “y”.)</p>\n<p><strong>But let’s take a step back.</strong> Linking to line numbers in code is useful when you want to point out a specific error or implementation technique: “Hey, check line 132 of app.go. You’re not closing the response body.”</p>\n<p>Most of the time, though, you actually want to <strong>link to a specific definition by name</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Hey, I think you should just use <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/golang/go/-/def/GoPackage/encoding/json/-/MarshalIndent\">json.MarshalIndent</a> here instead.”</li>\n<li>“Change this to use <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/kr/text/-/def/GoPackage/github.com/kr/text/-/WrapWords\">text.WrapWords</a>.”</li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"//images.contentful.com/le3mxztn6yoo/47219SjMUUCyUmae0mUaiq/77c4ca8dd8899369c758225af610282d/1_qwvlhN_OxHQH_aLVAkqBzw.png\" alt=\"1*qwvlhN OxHQH aLVAkqBzw\">\n<p>Where do you think <a href='https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/golang/go/-/info/GoPackage/fmt/-/Printf'>this</a> leads?</p>\n<p>In these cases, linking to the line number on GitHub means your link will quickly either become outdated (if you link to a branch) or will refer to an older version of the definition (if you link to a full commit ID).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com\">Sourcegraph</a> makes it possible to actually link to a definition with a <strong>URL for every function</strong>. These URLs <strong>always refer to the latest definition</strong> and <strong>won’t break if the file is edited</strong>, unlike links to a specific line number. You can also hack these URLs to quickly view other definitions (because the naming scheme is consistent and meaningful).</p>\n<img src=\"//images.contentful.com/le3mxztn6yoo/6RHjnUG01iYqWkC0UwYgSk/a07a58db31191f65d6eb193e30ddcf2a/1_FNueXlBj3w3TDrBGCVGHOw.png\" alt=\"1*FNueXlBj3w3TDrBGCVGHOw\">\n<p><a href='https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/golang/go/-/info/GoPackage/fmt/-/Printf'>A semantic URL to fmt.Printf on Sourcegraph</a></p>\n<p>These URLs also show other useful information about the definition: its type signature (with type inference for dynamic languages), usage examples, authors, users, etc. And you can link directly into source, as well:</p>\n<img src=\"//images.contentful.com/le3mxztn6yoo/1sMZNjBenmgyU6gSWaUwAm/c945535d8cb4b85d6348c614f54088f1/1_c2g_eZRzYBHm2FhJaQ1Amg.png\" alt=\"1*c2g eZRzYBHm2FhJaQ1Amg\">\n<p><a href='https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/golang/go/-/def/GoPackage/encoding/json/-/MarshalIndent'>The source code of a Go function, MarshalIndent, on Sourcegraph</a></p>\n<p>Lots of open source projects already use these Sourcegraph URLs to refer to specific functions in their docs and bug trackers (<a href=\"https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/22000\">Django</a>, for example).</p>\n<p>Here are some <strong>examples of named URLs</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go: <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/golang/go/-/def/GoPackage/encoding/json/-/MarshalIndent\">https://sourcegraph.com/<strong>github.com/golang/go</strong>/-/def/GoPackage/<strong>encoding/json</strong>/-/<strong>MarshalIndent</strong></a></li>\n<li>Go: <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/kr/text/-/def/GoPackage/github.com/kr/text/-/WrapWords\">https://sourcegraph.com/<strong>github.com/kr/text</strong>/-/def/GoPackage/github.com/kr/text/-/<strong>WrapWords</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>To get the named URL to a function</strong> on <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com\">Sourcegraph</a>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com\">Sign up for Sourcegraph</a> if you haven’t already (currently, global code search is only available to signed-in users).</li>\n<li>Search for the function you want to link to.</li>\n<li>Click on the result.</li>\n<li>Copy the URL in the address bar.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That’s it.
