So going back to Caddy apps and what you can do with them. I want to dive into some of the other things that you and perhaps members of the community have built through Caddy apps. Perhaps I’ll start with a personal anecdote, which is Sourcegraph. We support SSO because it’s often a requirement for the companies that we sell into, large enterprises, things like that. I was actually the one who wrote a lot of our original SSO code. I remember at the time looking into nginx plugins for SSO but getting lost in the documentation and there’s always that worry in the back of your mind where maybe it works for the first one or two cases but eventually you’re going to hit some edge case where either the plugin doesn’t support what you needed to do so then you’re left hitting in a brick wall. That’s why we ended up just building SSO into the Sourcegraph application itself but if I were writing that today knowing what I know about Caddy and Caddy apps and the plugin architecture. It seems like a much better path would’ve been to write SSO support as a Caddy app and because it’s just Go code I could just make it talk to whatever backend or database I needed it to connect to for user validation and things like that.
