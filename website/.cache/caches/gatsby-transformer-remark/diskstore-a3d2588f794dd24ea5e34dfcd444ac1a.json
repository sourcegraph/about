But I wasn’t really a childhood prodigy programmer of sorts, as you often hear from startup founders. The first time that I actually got into writing, I guess what you could consider to be code, wasn’t until high school. If you recall, the TI-84 calculator era and I don’t know if when you were in school, these games playing Mario and stuff like that, kind of went viral among high schoolers.

So at my high school, and I think this might have been like eighth grade or freshman year, I don’t really know. And at the time when you’d want to pass games to one another, you would connect your two calculators together and then transfer the games and then go about your way.

And so I just started slipping it into transferring games to one another, because I was one of the first ones to get like Mario and these other sorts of games. And then I would just transfer it onto their calculator. I don’t remember what I called the program, but it wasn’t like “joke generator.” It was something kind of innocuous, like “quadratic formula” or something like that.
