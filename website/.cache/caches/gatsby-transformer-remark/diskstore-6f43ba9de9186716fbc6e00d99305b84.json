And most often folks aren’t theming Google docs, they are tricking it out with extensions to look super pleasing. But as developers, that’s not the case at all. We spend a long time customizing and curating our font sizes. Which side of the editor is your file tree on? What color theme?

And so with Live Share, it became very clear that the collaboration from a tool or from an environment that was so highly tuned for individual preference and ergonomics and visual familiarity and enjoyment, that it felt like a big miss for collaboration to have to occur by means of one person effectively looking at the world to the other person’s lens, which is what happens with screen sharing. And so with Live Share, instead of opening up a screen share or pushing changes back and forth maybe via a gate branch that you’re using for asynchronous collaboration, it allows you to just at any time push the share button, get a URL, and then send that to someone.","position":{"start":{"line":88,"column":14,"offset":8752},"end":{"line":89,"column":804,"offset":9556},"indent":[1]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":88,"column":1,"offset":8739},"end":{"line":89,"column":804,"offset":9556},"indent":[1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"strong","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Jonathan:","position":{"start":{"line":91,"column":3,"offset":9560},"end":{"line":91,"column":12,"offset":9569},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":91,"column":1,"offset":9558},"end":{"line":91,"column":14,"offset":9571},"indent":[]}},{"type":"text","value":"\nThey can then effectively connect their individualized instance of the VS or VS Code to your session and then share just the context of the code base that you have open, and any of the supporting editor or runtime state needed to collaborate on it.

So we hear the traditional kind of driver or navigator model or ping pong Pair programming. There’s quite a diverse set of ways that people can collaborate. But unfortunately, there’s really not a great one size fits all model for how collaboration can be not only efficient for people, but actually something you enjoy to do.

So, yeah. We’ve talked to so many teams where they express the sentiment of wanting to do more open source contributions or wanting to contribute to, not even just open source, but as I mentioned, Inner source.

For example, maybe they had tried a web editor or a web IDE in the past, but it was significantly different from what they would otherwise have used, or it was significantly fragmented from the ecosystem that they otherwise wanted to be a part of.

And so with Codespaces, because the editing experience is literally full fidelity 100% Visual Studio code, in your browser, we believe that it changes a huge reason why people were originally very hesitant to even explore web-based editors. Because all of a sudden, every extension that you’re using today or that you want to potentially use in the future, is going to work.

I happen to be a person that does.

And so if you look on Twitter, for example, and you search for Codespaces, you’ll just see a sea of folks where their first reaction is, “Wow, I can’t believe X works.” Or, “This extension works.” I would’ve swore this couldn’t possibly work, but it does, which is great.

What’s the next problem that that developer is going to hit in terms of being successful? And how do we embrace onboarding from a holistic sense versus just thinking about it from setting up a dev box in the cloud.” And so with CodeTour, that became an exploration into how could we move onboarding or developer documentation closer to the code itself so that it became immediately recognizable and immersive once somebody had jumped into a code space or clone to repo and opened it in their editor.

So each step could not just explain a part of the code base, but it could then actually have mechanisms for guiding you through doing a build of the project, or automating beginning a debugging session, or helping show here’s where you would create a file to add a new component to the repository for, let’s say, a react JS application.","position":{"start":{"line":199,"column":14,"offset":33829},"end":{"line":200,"column":747,"offset":34576},"indent":[1]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":199,"column":1,"offset":33816},"end":{"line":200,"column":747,"offset":34576},"indent":[1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"strong","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Jonathan:","position":{"start":{"line":202,"column":3,"offset":34580},"end":{"line":202,"column":12,"offset":34589},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":202,"column":1,"offset":34578},"end":{"line":202,"column":14,"offset":34591},"indent":[]}},{"type":"text","value":"\nAnd so yeah, really CodeTour, it currently writes an extension for VS Code that lets you record and then playback multi-step guided walkthroughs of a code base.

And so the way that it works is you just click a button to start a new tour, and then within VS Code, you can then navigate files and start adding annotations to lines of code with the necessary pros much like you might add comments to a pool request. And so those steps are ordered and you can rearrange them. And behind the scenes, the tour itself has persisted as just adjacent file in the repository itself, which makes it easy to do code reviewing on it, to collaborate.","position":{"start":{"line":202,"column":14,"offset":34591},"end":{"line":203,"column":810,"offset":35401},"indent":[1]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":202,"column":1,"offset":34578},"end":{"line":203,"column":810,"offset":35401},"indent":[1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"strong","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Jonathan:","position":{"start":{"line":205,"column":3,"offset":35405},"end":{"line":205,"column":12,"offset":35414},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":205,"column":1,"offset":35403},"end":{"line":205,"column":14,"offset":35416},"indent":[]}},{"type":"text","value":"\nRight now CodeTour only supports VS Code.

How do we make collaboration and the sharing of knowledge better in a way where we accept that documentation that is a secondary asset outside of your editor is easy to ignore, easy not to maintain?

And GitHub repos just surpassed a thousand stars, which is minuscule compared to a lot of projects. So yeah, it’s been exciting to see the interest in folks.

It’s like where are there areas that just feel really ready for a bit of love.

That said, within my side projects and amongst some of the open source work that I do with some of my frequent collaborators, so to speak, yeah. We have started using CodeTour for doing documentation, so to speak, of like, “Hey, I just added this new area of the code base. And while it’s fresh in my mind, let me go ahead and just create a quick Tour.” And so a lot of the refinement that we’ve done over the last few months trying to improve or streamline the offering experience, was based on actually using it. And then I’ve also been pretty keen on collaborating and chatting with other folks that are actually using it in practice. Where we have a few learning platforms that have started to express some interest in looking at CodeTour as a means for providing a bit more interactivity for their content within the editor versus having a documentation page and then asking somebody to switch to their editor and then switch back to the docs, and maybe lose some of their contexts in the process.","position":{"start":{"line":220,"column":14,"offset":37809},"end":{"line":221,"column":1075,"offset":38884},"indent":[1]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":220,"column":1,"offset":37796},"end":{"line":221,"column":1075,"offset":38884},"indent":[1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"strong","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Jonathan:","position":{"start":{"line":223,"column":3,"offset":38888},"end":{"line":223,"column":12,"offset":38897},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":223,"column":1,"offset":38886},"end":{"line":223,"column":14,"offset":38899},"indent":[]}},{"type":"text","value":"\nAnd so I would say CodeTour is very early in its stages of validating whether or not this is the right approach. And so right now I’m very focused and keen on looking to get more success stories from folks. We have a lot of interests right now, but I think there’s still a couple of interesting challenges ahead, which is good. Because that’s one of the reasons why I like doing extra curricular explorations is because sometimes there’s only so much you can predict or learn through research versus… To me, I like open source because it’s almost like having a conversation with the ecosystem by means of a MVP or a prototype or something where if you try to explain it in the abstract, it would be maybe a little bit less clear what you were talking about versus being able to illustrate or demonstrate the beginning of an idea that you then want to use to see the discussion around, getting to something that is truly achieving the goal that it has. So I think there’s quite a bit of room for improvement with CodeTour, but we’ve seen some pretty exciting early usage of it in education and training and team onboarding that I think for us to scale it up a bit more within Microsoft, we would need at a minimum Visual Studio support.

And so one thing that we’ve been working on that I’m pretty excited about is this feature with IntelliCode called suggestions where it will actually observe patterns and ‘repeated edits’ that you’re making while you’re coding and then suggest other locations within the code base that you can make similar changes. For example, if you’re making a refactoring or making a kind of a style change, it’s a very common bug we’ve observed where folks maybe aren’t aware of all the other locations that they could make that change or if they tried to do a find across the code base to regular expression they would need to write would be sufficiently complex that they just don’t do it.","position":{"start":{"line":229,"column":14,"offset":40447},"end":{"line":230,"column":1100,"offset":41547},"indent":[1]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":229,"column":1,"offset":40434},"end":{"line":230,"column":1100,"offset":41547},"indent":[1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"strong","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Jonathan:","position":{"start":{"line":232,"column":3,"offset":41551},"end":{"line":232,"column":12,"offset":41560},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":232,"column":1,"offset":41549},"end":{"line":232,"column":14,"offset":41562},"indent":[]}},{"type":"text","value":"\nWhereas with this kind of capability that we’re working on, we are excited to be able to turn your intent.

And then also in the long-term be able to codify in a way that maybe becomes almost like de facto style or best practice guidelines for your team, that you can help each other remain more consistent and make the code base more maintainable over time.
