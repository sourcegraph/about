We deprecated the feature last September, and as of January 20, 2021, it has been removed for all users.</p>\n<p>We made this change based on feedback we received from our customers: interactive search mode is no longer the default search mode that best serves our users. Our newer plain text search input is smarter, with improved <a href=\"https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search/reference/queries\">search query syntax</a>, <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/392761379\">search bar highlighting</a>, and <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/374329715\">autocomplete</a>. Fully removing interactive search mode and making plain text search the default for all users allows us to deliver a better experience and continue improving our search interface.</p>\n<p>If you have additional questions regarding this change, please contact <a href=\"mailto:support@sourcegraph.com\">support@sourcegraph.com</a>.
