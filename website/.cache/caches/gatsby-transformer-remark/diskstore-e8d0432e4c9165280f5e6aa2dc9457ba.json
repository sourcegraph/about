On the first day he takes a can of paint out to the road and finishes 300 yards of the road. “That’s pretty good!” says his boss, “you’re a fast worker!” and pays him a kopeck.</p>\n<p>The next day Shlemiel only gets 150 yards done. “Well, that’s not nearly as good as yesterday, but you’re still a fast worker. 150 yards is respectable,” and pays him a kopeck.</p>\n<p>The next day Shlemiel paints 30 yards of the road. “Only 30!” shouts his boss. “That’s unacceptable! On the first day you did ten times that much work! What’s going on?”</p>\n<p>“I can’t help it,” says Shlemiel. “Every day I get farther and farther away from the paint can!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Shlemiel and lsif-go both spent a lot of time needlessly re-executing the same operations in a way that did not help progress the task. Because an operation of non-constant cost was snuck into the lower levels of the process - into a method that was itself called a non-constant number of times - they both found themselves in a process that is <a href=\"https://accidentallyquadratic.tumblr.com/\">accidentally quadratic</a>.</p>\n<p>As part of indexing, we extract the docstring attached to each symbol. In the comment extraction process is this innocuous-looking <a href=\"https://github.com/sourcegraph/lsif-go/blob/1ac006466179176711e61e89dbf136d49e9fab34/internal/index/helper.go#L241\">line of code</a> that finds the closest comment attached to an identifier in the AST. The <code class=\"language-text\">findComments</code> function containing this line of code is actually called once on <strong>every</strong> identifier being indexed. This function is called for every type definition, every field, every function, every parameter, every local variable, and every type. Every identifier causes another traversal of the tree. Again and again, lsif-go would trace the same set of edges only find itself at a node on a path only <em>slightly</em> different from a previous traversal.</p>\n<p>The following shows a <em>very</em> reduced Go AST for the EKS API from the Go AWS SDK (click to enlarge). Here we’re going to concentrate on the definition of the struct <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go@a3411680ac767bb37ff50c73e58c53e2426fd80a/-/blob/service/eks/api.go#L2769:6\"><code class=\"language-text\">CreateClusterInput</code></a>.</p>\n<div class=\"no-shadow\">\n  <a href=\"https://sourcegraphstatic.com/blog/lsif-go/lsif-go-ast.svg\" target=\"_blank\">\n    <img src=\"https://sourcegraphstatic.com/blog/lsif-go/lsif-go-ast.svg\" alt=\"Go AST\">\n  </a>\n</div>\n<p>This struct contains 9 fields, meaning that there are 18 identifiers within the struct body: one for the field name and one for the field type. To find each of these nodes, the same three edges (<code class=\"language-text\">File</code> to <code class=\"language-text\">GenDecl</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">GenDecl</code> to <code class=\"language-text\">TypeSpec</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">TypeSpec</code> to <code class=\"language-text\">FieldList</code>) need to be traversed. In addition, this file contains definitions for 94 constants, 76 other struct types, 510 methods, and 21 functions. Each traversal needs to exclude these non-relevant subtrees when searching for a particular node, which also costs a non-negligible amount of time. Walking the same tree for a file with tens or hundreds of thousands of identifiers can really put a dent in the indexer’s throughput.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/sourcegraph/lsif-go/pull/66\">solution</a> we implemented instead performs a single walk of the AST of each file and caches the comments attached to each identifier node along the way. Then each node can simply look up its own comment in a shared, pre-populated cache during the relevant indexing step. This change cut indexing time of the Go AWS SDK by 4x.</p>\n<p>It turns out that lsif-go was <em>still</em> traversing syntax trees multiple times in order to generate additional data for each symbol: its <em>moniker</em>. A moniker is a unique name (within the same index) for a definition and is used link symbols together across repository boundaries. For example, keeping the spirit of the examples above:</p>\n<p class=\"text-center\">\n  <code class=\"language-text\">github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/eks:CreateClusterInput.ResourcesVpcConfig</code>\n</p>\n<p>These AST traversals were also <a href=\"https://github.com/sourcegraph/lsif-go/pull/77\">easy enough to optimize</a>. While performing the walk of the AST to cache comments attached to nodes, we also keep track of the qualified names on the path down to a node (names of types containing fields, receiver types attached to functions) and cache those.</p>\n<p>Now, we’ve greatly reduced the number of AST traversals that we perform, but that doesn’t mean that the traversals we’re still doing are efficient. When we traverse an AST, we only store the comments and monikers for nodes that we think define a symbol. Symbols that are not a definition will use the hover text and moniker of the symbol they reference. However, when looking at each node to determine if we cared about its hover text or moniker, we were looking at <em>too much</em> information.</p>\n<p>One of the inputs of the traversal is an ordered list of token positions for each definition in the file. When a node is visited, we check to see if the node encloses a position in the list. If it doesn’t, the subtree can be skipped. If it does, then the node’s children should be visited as the node’s subtree contains a definition. If a node’s position <em>equals</em> a position in the list, then the node itself is a definition and a hover text and moniker entry should be set for that node.</p>\n<p>Because the list of positions are ordered, we can use binary search to efficiently determine which of these three conditions are true for a node. But efficient does not equate to <em>most efficient</em>. Each layer of the tree received the same list of positions, meaning that the binary search operation for every node had the same cost.</p>\n<p>It is <a href=\"https://github.com/sourcegraph/lsif-go/pull/84\">much more efficient</a> to instead pass along only the positions which can match a subtree. This change means that the binary search for a node decreases as its depth increases: the leaves of the tree have to search a much smaller list. Because the number of nodes in the tree (generally) increases with depth, this cost savings is compounded.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Batch-what-you-can\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Batch-what-you-can\" aria-label=\"Batch what you can permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Batch what you can</h3>\n<p>An LSIF indexer is a tool that spits out an index file. The index file is generally larger than the input source code due to making the implicit definition and reference relationships explicit. It stands to reason that the performance of the indexer will eventually be dependent on the performance of formatting the output and writing to disk.</p>\n<p>The LSIF index file is formatted as sequence of newline-separated JSON elements. These elements are generally pretty small with the exception of hover content vertices and contains edges adjacent to large documents. From a dump of 14 million lines, the median line contained only 91 characters (a line with 48 characters being the smallest).</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we were writing each line to an unbuffered file. Without a buffer, writing each element requires a <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html\">syscsall</a> to commit a small amount of data to the target file. With a <a href=\"https://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/go-performance-observations#buffered-io\">buffer</a>, the writes are batched so that 4096 characters are written to disk at a time. This reduces the number of syscalls, and therefore number of userland/kernel context switches, by 98%.</p>\n<p>This <a href=\"https://github.com/sourcegraph/lsif-go/pull/79\">change</a> significantly improved performance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Parallelize-where-possible\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Parallelize-where-possible\" aria-label=\"Parallelize where possible permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Parallelize where possible</h3>\n<p>The implementation of the indexer has historically been single-threaded for simplicity.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgflip.com/4bwccv.jpg\" alt=\"All my idle cores\">\n<p>Sourcegraph is often deployed onto nodes with many CPUs, but our indexer was only able to use one at a time. We’ve realized what a waste the single-threaded design was after one of our enterprise customers showed us lsif-go consuming 100% of one core, and 0% of the other 95 cores. There’s no way we’re going to miss the opportunity to see all 96 of those cores light up the next time we chat. So we made everything that is able to run at the same time <a href=\"https://github.com/sourcegraph/lsif-go/pull/91\">run at the same time</a>. Unfortunately, parallelizing workloads in general is not a trivial task.</p>\n<p><strong>Shared state must be protected from concurrent access and mutation.</strong> We did this by introducing a mutex around each shared map and slice that can be read from and written to concurrently. We use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-checked_locking\">double-checked locking</a> where exclusive access to the datastructure for writing is required:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"go\"><pre class=\"language-go\"><code class=\"language-go\"><span class=\"token keyword\">func</span> <span class=\"token function\">ensureValue</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>key <span class=\"token builtin\">string</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> f <span class=\"token keyword\">func</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">string</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">string</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\">// fast path</span>\n    mutex<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">RLock</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n    value<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> ok <span class=\"token operator\">:=</span> m<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>key<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n    mutex<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">RUnlock</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token operator\">!</span>ok <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> value\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n    <span class=\"token comment\">// slow path</span>\n    mutex<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">Lock</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">defer</span> mutex<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">Unlock</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> value<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> ok <span class=\"token operator\">:=</span> m<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>key<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> ok<span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> value\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n    <span class=\"token comment\">// note: f() can be moved outside of critical</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\">// section if it's expensive/side-effect free</span>\n    value <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">f</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n    m<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>key<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> value\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> value\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>This pattern first acquires a cheap read lock on <code class=\"language-text\">mutex</code> and checks the likely condition that the data has already been cached in the shared map <code class=\"language-text\">m</code>. If the value exists, it can be returned. Otherwise, a value needs to be generated and written to the shared map for later readers. In order to handle the race condition between releasing the read lock and acquiring the write lock, we check for the value in the map again after exclusive access has been acquired.</p>\n<p>Each shared datastructure has its own mutex so that contention from one resource does not bleed into a less-contended resource. However, it’s easy to take this pattern too far. One of our resources is a two-layered hierarchical map from documents to ranges, then ranges to range data. The first layer is not mutated, but the second layer is. Go’s <code class=\"language-text\">RWMutex</code> struct has three <code class=\"language-text\">uint32</code> fields and three <code class=\"language-text\">int32</code> fields, meaning that each mutex takes 192 bytes. If we were to give each inner map its own mutex, then our memory usage would blow up <em>fast</em>. Indexing the Go AWS SDK would require an additional 2.7G of memory for these mutexes alone.</p>\n<p>Instead, we can protect the inner map with a <a href=\"https://guava.dev/releases/19.0/api/docs/com/google/common/util/concurrent/Striped.html\">striped mutex</a>. A striped mutex is basically an array of shared mutexes, where a resource <code class=\"language-text\">r</code> is locked if the mutex at index <code class=\"language-text\">hash(r)</code> is locked (modulo the configured number of mutexes). This is a good middle-ground between having one mutex for a highly contended resource, and having <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> distinct mutexes for a map with <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> keys.</p>\n<p><strong>Work must be scheduled around data dependencies.</strong> Previously, lsif-go was set up as a simple pipeline for readability. Some (but not all) of these pipeline steps are a prerequisite for some future step. For example, we assume that our map of definitions is already populated by the time we start to index references.</p>\n<p>Due to such data dependencies, it would be an obviously incorrect solution to run all of the pipeline steps in parallel. Our solution is to parallelize the workload in distinct steps (first index all definitions, then index all references), where each step can rely on data calculated by the previous step which was parallelized individually.</p>\n<p>Alternative solutions here require pushing back tasks whose dependencies have not yet been met, pre-determining a dependency graph, or recursively submitting duplicate work to the queue. Each of these solutions have a down side and decrease code clarity.</p>\n<p><strong>The right level of work must be chosen for parallelization.</strong> You can’t throw work into a parallel executor and guarantee that your program runs faster. In fact, the first few attempts at parallelizing lsif-go weren’t fruitful because we tried to index each <em>file</em> in parallel rather than each <em>package</em>. The cost of indexing a single file was low enough that the overhead of setting up the goroutines and queueing the work negated any benefit of executing the work in multiple cores.</p>\n<p>The cost of indexing an entire package is high enough that there is obvious, tangible benefit of indexing multiple packages in different cores. This benefit far outweighs the any of the setup and queueing overhead.</p>\n<div class=\"no-shadow\">\n  <img src=\"https://sourcegraphstatic.com/blog/lsif-go/lsif-go-parallel.svg\" alt=\"Parallelism diagram\">\n</div>\n<p>In the current version of lsif-go, all writes to the file are synchronized by a single goroutine controlling the output buffer. This ensures that for any single goroutine emitting elements, the order of the elements they emit will hit disk in the same order. This is important as LSIF requires that edges refer only to a vertex that has already been indexed.</p>\n<p>Each non-trivial task is broken into package-level work, queued into a channel, and then distributed over a number of goroutines (that scales depending on the number of physical cores on the indexing machine). A task finishes once the entire input channel has been consumed and each worker goroutine has exited. Each task makes a fresh set of goroutines.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Reviewing-results\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Reviewing-results\" aria-label=\"Reviewing results permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 18 95 120\" height=\"18\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M53.69,78.7H37.94l-5.85,25H21.74l5.85-25H15.89L18,69.1H29.84l4.65-19.65H23.39l2.1-9.6H36.74l5.7-23.7H52.79l-5.7,23.7H62.84l5.7-23.7H78.89l-5.7,23.7H84.74l-2.4,9.6H70.94L66.29,69.1H77.24l-2.4,9.6H64l-5.85,25H47.84Zm-13.5-9.6H55.94l4.65-19.65H44.84Z\"/></svg></a>Reviewing results</h2>\n<p>The following chart show the comparison between lsif-go v0.9.0 (the un-optimized, previous release), v0.10.0 (some optimizations applied here), and v1.0 (the new stable release).</p>\n<div class=\"no-shadow\">\n  <img src=\"https://sourcegraphstatic.com/blog/lsif-go/lsif-go-perf-3.png\" alt=\"performance comparison\">\n</div>\n<p>Dropping the un-optimized v0.9.0 release from our data set, we get the following chart with better readability for the index time required by lsif-go v1.0.</p>\n<div class=\"no-shadow\">\n  <img src=\"https://sourcegraphstatic.com/blog/lsif-go/lsif-go-perf-2.png\" alt=\"performance comparison\">\n</div>\n<p>We’re still working on improving performance so every language, every codebase, and every programmer gets fast, precise code intelligence.
