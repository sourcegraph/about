                            Developer tools have made huge strides over the last decade, and useful new tools appear almost weekly. While 
                            devs are still productive with a terminal and an editor, contemporary tools can make it easier to search, read, 
                            and understand code, regardless of experience levels.
                        </p>

                            This quiz isn't a test or evaluation. It's a chance to think about your go-to workflows and tools for searching, 
                            reading, and understanding code â€“ and discover some new ones along the way.
