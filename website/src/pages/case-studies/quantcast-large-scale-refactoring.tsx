                        Quantcast uses machine-learning-driven, real-time audience insights to radically simplify
                        advertising for brands and customers such as BuzzFeed, Dell, and Fiat Chrysler. Quantcast is the
                        pulse of the open Internet, measuring billions of pseudonymized interactions per day so brands
                        can deeply understand and reach their audiences, all while protecting consumer privacy.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Founded in 2006, Quantcast’s engineering team had amassed thousands of repositories. This growth
                        made refactoring a difficult and time-consuming task for an unaided engineer to tackle. After
                        discovering and deploying Sourcegraph, Quantcast was able to do major refactors with confidence.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="pt-5 pb-1">GDPR readiness though organization-wide code search</h2>
                    <p>
                        May 2018 was the deadline for the EU General Data Protection Regulation, a law that provides
                        widespread protections for users and their personal data. Quantcast saw it as an opportunity to
                        strengthen their position as a privacy-first organization.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Quantcast created a tiger-team to not only meet GDPR compliance, but exceed the requirements.
                        They analyzed what services ought to handle GDPR-defined personal data, and used Sourcegraph to
                        discover which actually did. Personal data, such as IP addresses, can be identified within
                        source code by using Sourcegraph’s regular expression search. Searching for{' '}
                        <code className="language-text">"ip"</code> would return too many results.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Instead, Sourcegraph can search for fields within objects with:
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <pre className="language-regex">
                            <code
                                className="language-regex"
                                dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: `\\w+\\.ip(addr)?\\b` }}
                            />
                        </pre>
                        or addresses themselves with:
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <pre className="language-regex">
                            <code
                                className="language-regex"
                                dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: `\\b\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}\\b` }}
                            />
                        </pre>
                    </p>

                    <InContentBlockquote quote="Unlike other tools, Sourcegraph doesn’t just search for keywords, it searches for regular expressions. This familiar query language allowed us to zero-in on exactly what we wanted and filter out false matches." />

                    <p>
                        For every project, the team created a burndown list of issues and provided links to Sourcegraph
                        search results to the code owners. Since Sourcegraph searches every repository, a single
                        engineer took only a few days to analyze thousands of them, which would have taken months if
                        they were each examined individually.
                    </p>

                    <InContentBlockquote quote="Sourcegraph’s search gave us confidence because we knew we wouldn't overlook anything: Sourcegraph returns all search results, it doesn’t drop or elide them, unlike GitHub Enterprise." />

                    <p>
                        Each team was able to use the Sourcegraph searches to confirm that all of their outstanding
                        issues were addressed. Because Sourcegraph uses regular-expressions, familiar to most engineers,
                        these engineers easily adopted Sourcegraph to learn more about how their projects interacted
                        with other projects. As they fixed or addressed each issue, these Sourcegraph searches returned
                        fewer and fewer results.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="pt-5 pb-1">Preventing future issues with code monitoring and notifications</h2>

                    <p>
                        With more data privacy laws on the horizon (such as California’s Consumer Privacy Act),
                        Quantcast can navigate the shifting regulatory landscape. Using Sourcegraph’s saved searches,
                        senior engineers have an easy way to define patterns, set up ownership, and get early warning
                        alerts before any changes that affect personal data are merged.
                    </p>

                    <InContentBlockquote quote="Saved searches allow us to constantly monitor code that manages personal data, organization wide, before changes land in production." />

                    <h2 className="pt-5 pb-1">
                        Large scale refactoring is now possible without risking production stability
                    </h2>

                    <p>
                        Multi-repository code search makes large scale refactoring at Quantcast systematic, safe, and
                        efficient: enabling massive projects like GDPR compliance while saving hundreds of developer
                        hours without risking production stability.
                    </p>

                    <p className="pb-5">
                        Saved searches with email notifications empower teams to continuously monitor changes to code
                        handling personal information which mitigates compliance risk without distracting developers
                        from delivering business value.
