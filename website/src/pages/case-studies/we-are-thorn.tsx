                    <h2>Thorn defends children</h2>

                    <p>
                        Thorn builds technology to defend children from sexual abuse. Their work focuses on finding
                        victims of child sex trafficking quickly and eliminating child sexual abuse from the internet.
                        Thorn partners with tech companies, law enforcement, and other NGOs to build products to find
                        vulnerable child victims faster. Thorn's software has helped law enforcement reduce
                        investigation times by 60%, ensuring that more children are found, faster.
                    </p>

                        Sunsetting deprecated systems was costly and risked production stability
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Determining which code relied on legacy architecture was difficult. Developers took too long to
                        ensure that changes to legacy systems didn't affect production stability.
                    </p>
                    <InContentBlockquote quote="Ensuring that changes to legacy systems didn't affect production stability was taking too long." />

                    <p>
                        Over 9,000 officers in 38 countries rely on Thorn to identify child victims of sexual abuse. Any
                        downtime reduced Thorn’s ability to identify these children.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="pt-5 pb-1">Existing tooling was not sufficient</h2>

                    <p>
                        Tech debt and upkeep of legacy code were problematic. Previous attempts, such as cloning all
                        repositories locally and using grep to find references, were inadequate when considering
                        simultaneous development by multiple teams across many different projects, repositories, and
                        branches. Determining if all the different microservices were properly in sync when removing
                        legacy application code was painful.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="pt-5 pb-1">
                        Sourcegraph’s multi-repository code search proved that no code referencing legacy systems
                        existed across the organization
                    </h2>

                    <p>
                        Thorn Software Engineer Jacob Gillespie deployed Sourcegraph and synced Thorn’s entire list of
                        repositories within minutes. With Sourcegraph, Thorn could search over the contents of every
                        repository, in any or all branches in seconds. Sourcegraph code search gives Thorn the ability
                        to find references to deprecated systems.
                    </p>

                    <p>Sourcegraph is now essential to their code review process. </p>

                    <InContentBlockquote quote="In pull requests, team members include links to Sourcegraph code search to prove all references to a deprecated system have been removed, giving the reviewer confidence that the code is safe to merge." />

                    <h2 className="pt-5 pb-1">Deprecated systems were taken offline without downtime</h2>
                    <p>
                        Thorn’s developers removed or modified deprecated systems, eliminating huge amounts of tech
                        debt. This benefited all areas of the architecture, including not only application code, but
                        also build, deployment, logging, and monitoring systems—any tool that supported the deployment
                        and uptime of the application.
                    </p>

                    <p className="pb-5">
                        Using Sourcegraph provides critical support to Thorn’s mission. Every start-up has to make
                        choices about when to rebuild their systems and when to move forward accruing technical debt.
                        Modern microservice architecture makes the application deprecation process challenging.
