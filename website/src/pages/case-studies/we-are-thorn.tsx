                <h2>Thorn's mission</h2>

                <p>
                    Thorn builds technology to defend children from sexual abuse. Their work focuses on finding victims
                    of child sex trafficking faster, and eliminating child sexual abuse from the internet. Thorn partners
                    with tech companies, law enforcement, as well as other NGOs, to build products that provide the
                    front lines with the latest technology to find the most vulnerable child victims faster.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thorn’s life changing work and not-for-profit status made it a simple decision to provide
                    Sourcegraph’s enterprise features free of charge. For many children, Thorn plays a critical role in
                    speeding up the time it takes for them to be identified and we’re proud to be supporting them with
                    their mission.
                </p>

                <h2 class="pt-5 pb-1">
                    Sunsetting deprecated systems was previously costly and risked production stability
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As Thorn’s products evolved, it became difficult to trace the impact of code changes to core
                    application components, as it was difficult to determine what code might rely on legacy
                    architecture, risking instability and greatly increasing the demand on development and review.
                </p>

                <InContentBlockquote quote="It was time-consuming for developers and reviewers to ensure that changes to legacy systems didn’t affect our production stability." />

                <p>
                    Over 9,000 officers in 38 countries rely on Thorn’s systems to identify child victims of sexual
                    abuse. Any downtime of these services has a negative impact on Thorn’s ability to identify children
                    globally.
                </p>

                <h2 class="pt-5 pb-1">Existing tooling was not sufficient</h2>

                <p>
                    Tech debt, and the upkeep of legacy code was becoming increasingly problematic. Previous attempts,
                    such as cloning all repositories locally and using grep to find references, were inadequate,
                    especially when considering simultaneous development by multiple teams across many different
                    projects, repositories, and branches. It was costly to determine if all the different microservices
                    were properly in sync when removing legacy application code.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sourcegraph’s multi-repository code search, was able to prove that no code referencing legacy
                    systems exists organization-wide.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thorn Software Engineer Jacob Gillespie deployed Sourcegraph and synced Thorn’s entire list of
                    repositories within minutes.
                </p>

                <InContentBlockquote quote="With Sourcegraph, we could search over the contents of every repository, in any or all branches in seconds." />

                <p>
                    Sourcegraph code search gave Thorn the ability to find references to deprecated systems. But more
                    importantly, it proved itself to be an invaluable new part of their code review process.
                </p>

                <InContentBlockquote quote="In pull requests, team members would include links to Sourcegraph code search, in order to prove all references to a deprecated system had been removed. This gave the reviewer confidence that the code was safe to merge." />

                <h2 class="pt-5 pb-1">As a result, deprecated systems were taken offline without downtime.</h2>
                <p>
                    Thorn’s developers could then systematically remove or modify deprecated systems, removing huge
                    amounts of tech debt in the process. This benefited all areas of the architecture, including not
                    only application code, but also build, deployment, logging, and monitoring systems—any tool that
                    supported the deployment and uptime of the application.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Modern microservice architecture makes the application deprecation process more challenging than
                    ever.{' '}
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Sourcegraph’s code search enables developers and DevOps teams to find dead code, unused
                        packages, and references to deprecated systems, organization wide across tens of thousands of
                        repositories.
                    </strong>
                </p>

                <p class="pb-4">
                    Being able to take advantage of industry leading solutions like Sourcegraph provides critical
                    support to Thorn’s mission. Every start-up has to make choices about when to rebuild their systems
                    and when to move forward accruing technical debt, Thorn is no different, but here at Sourcegraph,
                    we’re proud that our tools could be used to make the Thorn team a little more successful, a little
                    faster.
