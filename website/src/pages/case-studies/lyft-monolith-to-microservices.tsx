                        Lyft's mission is to improve people's lives with the world's best transportation. With over 30
                        million riders in 2018, Lyft's business is growing, as is the number of engineers, repositories,
                        and microservices. Effectively scaling and managing a large engineering organization requires an
                        elite set of development tools and practices to preserve efficiency, while protecting and
                        enhancing code quality.

                        Read on to learn how Lyft used Sourcegraph code search to provide a company wide verification
                        stage to confirm all call sites to previous monolith code had been updated before deploying to
                        production.
