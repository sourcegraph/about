                        Lyft's mission is to improve people's lives with the world's best transportation. With over 30
                        million riders in 2018, Lyft's business is growing, as is the number of engineers, repositories,
                        and microservices. Effectively scaling and managing a large engineering organization requires an
                        elite set of development tools and practices to preserve efficiency, while protecting, and
                        enhancing code quality.

                        Learn how Lyft used Sourcegraph code search to provide a company wide verification stage to
                        confirm all call sites to previous monolith code had been updated before deploying to
                        production.

                    <p>
                        The largest refactoring effort in Lyft's 10 year history came in 2018 when the number one
                        company priority was the decomposition of the PHP monolith to microservices.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Performing such significant and wide-ranging code changes meant extensive analysis was required
                        to verify all call sites and references to the monolith has been updated. This meant
                        transforming monolioth code to consuming the new microservice API endpoints, which in many
                        cases, meant altering the API schema.
                    </p>

                        This wasn't simply slicing up the monolith by domain into separate servicesâ€”it was also a
                        crucial opportunity to eliminate tech debt by removing dead code, deprecated libraries, and
                        unused API and database fields.
