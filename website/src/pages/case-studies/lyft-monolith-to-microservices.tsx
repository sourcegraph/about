                        Lyft's mission is to improve people's lives with the world's best transportation. With over 30
                        million riders in 2018, Lyft's business is growing, as are the numbers of engineers,
                        repositories, and microservices. Effectively scaling and managing a large engineering
                        organization requires an elite set of development tools and practices to preserve efficiency,
                        while protecting, and enhancing code quality.

                    <p>
                        The largest refactoring effort in Lyft's 10-year history came in 2018 when the number one
                        company priority was the decomposition of the PHP monolith to microservices.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Performing such significant and wide-ranging code changes meant extensive analysis was required
                        to verify all call sites and references to the monolith had been updated. This meant
                        transforming monolith code to consuming the new microservice API endpoints, which in many cases,
                        meant altering an API schema.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This wasn't simply slicing up the monolith by domain into separate services—it was also a
                        crucial opportunity to eliminate tech debt by removing dead code, deprecated libraries, and
                        unused API and database fields.
                    </p>

                    <InContentBlockquote
                        quote="During our decomp efforts, we also spent time to refactor our APIs. Many of these APIs were undocumented and lacked a formalized contract.
                    <br/><br/>
                    With the help of Sourcegraph, we were able to quickly look at all clients of an API and remove unused attributes that lived in different repositories, ultimately simplifying our APIs and speeding up developer iteration time."

                        With the confidence gained from the successful PHP monolith decomposition, new projects are
                        underway to reduce tech debt by more aggressively tackling migrations and the deprecation of
                        systems.
