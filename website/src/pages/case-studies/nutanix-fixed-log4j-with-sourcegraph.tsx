                    As the Technical Director of Solution Engineering at Nutanix, Jon Kohler understands the complexity
                    involved in securing the multitude of applications and solutions required to power such a large
                    organization. “Security is something that we care about intensely here at Nutanix,” Jon said,
                    “because it's part of our bedrock. It's why customers like us, and we have to take it seriously.”

                <p>
                    <span className="font-weight-bold">In December of 2021, </span>
                    software companies around the world discovered that Log4j, an open-source logging library bundled in
                    many software packages, contained significant vulnerabilities, one of which was a{' '}

                </p>
                <p>
                    Jon discovered that the offending module recurred throughout their build. “The more we dug,” Jon
                    explained, “the more we realized this bug was everywhere and nowhere at the same time.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nutanix moved quickly, despite having multiple build and artifact management systems, as well as a
                    large monorepo with many component branches and hundreds of git repositories. In under four days,
                    Nutanix was able to deliver patches to its customers that fully remediated the Log4j vulnerability.

                    Nutanix used Sourcegraph to identify every instance of Log4j within 2 days

                <p>
                    <span className="font-weight-bold">Speed was of the essence, </span>
                    but the timing of the Log4j news, which broke right before many employees go on vacation for the
                    winter holidays, didn't make things easy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, Nutanix armed its engineers with Sourcegraph. Within a couple of days, a few Sourcegraph
                    queries identified every instance of the Log4j vulnerability.
                </p>

                    </a>
                    . Jon used Sourcegraph to see where JMSAppender existed, fixed it, and sent out a release. “That
                    took almost less than five minutes,” Jon said. Sourcegraph released a
                    <Link to="/blog/log4j-log4shell-0-day/"> blog post </Link>
                    that explained how other companies addressing Log4j could use code search for similar benefits.
                </p>
                <p>This speed gave the team a head start on mitigation.</p>
                <p>Deploying these fixes required quality assurance and testing as well as discovery and fixing.</p>
                <p>
                    With the help of Sourcegraph, Nutanix was able to release three back-to-back patches relatively
                    quickly compared to other companies. Nutanix's customers reported satisfaction with both the speed
                    of the patches and their quality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “We tried to take a measured approach,” Jon said. “We wanted to get things done quickly but without
                    completely flying by the seats of our pants.”

                        Nutanix needed that confidence because of its sprawling codebase. One thing that made Log4j
                        especially complicated for Nutanix—as it does for other large-scale enterprises—is that there
                        were multiple source control systems in play. Sourcegraph provided them with “unified
                        visibility,” according to Jon. “I can't imagine the pain of having to do that either with grep
                        or OpenGrok,” he added.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Confidence spread from Jon to the rest of the team and throughout the company. With
                        <Link to="/blog/introducing-search-contexts/"> search contexts</Link>, Jon was able to share
                        relevant contexts and queries, showing the team how they could verify whether a given Log4j
                        instance was present or absent. He could show them precisely what they changed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “We used Sourcegraph contexts to see specifically where a service was at any given point in
                        time,” Jon said. Without Sourcegraph, the team would've had to use code scanning, which takes a
                        lot of time, or manual build inspections, which aren't foolproof.

                        Nutanix was able to transform a trust-threatening risk into a trust-building opportunity. Their
                        customers, Jon explained, were worried about hundreds of other vendors, all of whom were likely
                        affected by Log4j.

                    <p>
                        “That's hopefully something customers will remember us for,” Jon said. “We quickly either
                        provided them with clarity or gave them a line on the next available patch because we were able
                        to identify the issue and start fixing it ASAP.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jon explained that, at many enterprises, dependencies are unseen and forgotten. “You might check
                        in on a dependency and find it hasn't been reviewed for four, five, six, or even ten years. But
                        it works, so why update it?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Log4j is one of many reasons why monitoring and updating is now a renewed priority. “Companies
                        will have to be more diligent,” Jon said. With Sourcegraph, Nutanix is prepared to
