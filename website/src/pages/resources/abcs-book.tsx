                        The A-Z format introduces simple concepts in a fun and easy-to-understand way so that kids can
                        get curious about coding and perhaps, take the first step in beginning their journey in learning
                        how to code. Or at least, provide an engaging and educational distraction to give you a break
                        for a few minutes!

                    <h2>FAQs</h2>

                    <p>We've had quite a few folks reach out with questions about printing and future books.</p>

                    <h3 className="h4 pt-3">Do you plan on selling this as a physical book?</h3>
                    <p>
                        We want to make it easy for folks to get a physical copy and while we don’t (yet) have plans to
                        print and distribute, we’re looking into vendors that can print and ship on demand. In any case,
                        the PDF is high-resolution so you can print it yourself.
                    </p>

                    <h3 className="h4 pt-3">Do you have any other books like this planned?</h3>
                    <p>
                        We've been blown away by the response to this book and while we'd love to add "children's book
                        authoring" to the list of Sourcegraph features, we haven't yet decided if we plan to turn this
                        into a series of similar books.
