                    A <strong>developer platform</strong> is the one place where developers and DevOps teams go to
                    answer questions about code and systems. It ties together information from many tools, from
                    repositories on your code host to dependency relationships among your projects and application
                    runtime information.

                    Historically, the code host (such as GitHub) was the development platform. But the most elite
