# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence.

# We prefer to use Codenotify (https://github.com/sourcegraph/codenotify) instead of CODEOWNERS.
# More context is in this blog post: https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/a-different-way-to-think-about-code-ownership/
# If you are tempted to add an entry to CODEOWNERS, please try using Codenotify first for some amount of time.
# If Codenotify does not satisfy your needs, then you can open a PR to propose adding a new entry to CODEOWNERS and Nick will review.
# The PR description should describe why using Codenotify was insufficient. Thanks!
