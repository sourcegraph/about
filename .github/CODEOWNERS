# Lines starting with '#' are comments.

# The "nobody" team is an alerting mechanism that indicates when there are files in a PR that are
# not owned by anyone. This is a signal to the PR author that certain modified files are unowned and
# they need to (1) track down the owners using git blame and (2) update CODEOWNERS.
