title: "Strange Loop 2019 - Everything You Wanted to Know About Distributed Tracing"
description: "In the age of microservices, understanding how applications are executing in a highly distributed environment can be complicated. Looking at log files only gives a snapshot of the whole story and looking at a single service in isolation simply does not give enough information. Each service is just one side of a bigger story. Distributed tracing has emerged as an invaluable technique that succeeds in summarizing all sides of the story into a shared timeline. Yet deploying it can be quite challenging, especially in the large scale, polyglot environments of modern companies that mix together many different technologies. During this session, we will take a look at patterns and means to implement Tracing for services. After introducing the basic concepts we will cover how the tracing model works, and how to safely use it in production to troubleshoot and diagnose issues."

## Overview

In the age of microservices, understanding how applications are executing in a highly distributed environment can be complicated. Looking at log files only gives a snapshot of the whole story and looking at a single service in isolation simply does not give enough information. Each service is just one side of a bigger story. Distributed tracing has emerged as an invaluable technique that succeeds in summarizing all sides of the story into a shared timeline. Yet deploying it can be quite challenging, especially in the large scale, polyglot environments of modern companies that mix together many different technologies. During this session, we will take a look at patterns and means to implement Tracing for services. After introducing the basic concepts we will cover how the tracing model works, and how to safely use it in production to troubleshoot and diagnose issues.

AWESOME LIVEBLOG CONTENT HERE!

<!-- Note on images
  Images (e.g. my_image.jpg) should be put in the `website/static/blog/strange-loop-2019` directory, with the path to the image in your post being `/blog/strange-loop-2019/my_image.jpg`. If you'd rather host the images somewhere else for ease of use, that's fine too.

  Please also try to keep your images to a reasonable size by:
    - Using JPEG compression, unless image is mostly solid color 
    - JPEG compression set between 60%-80%
    - Resizing the image to be no wider then 750px
    - If PNG, use a tool like ImageOptim (https://imageoptim.com/mac) to optimize the file size

  I suggest re-sizing and compressing all the images in one batch as a last step.
