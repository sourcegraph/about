[Felicis Ventures](https://www.felicis.com) has invested an additional $5M investment in our Series B round, bringing the total amount raised to over $46 million. This comes after our $23 million Series B [funding](https://about.sourcegraph.com/press-releases/sourcegraph-secures-series-b) round back in March 2020 (before the pandemic — remember then?) and increases the company’s valuation by over 40 percent.

2020 has been a transformational year for Sourcegraph, with new customers and usage expansion in recent months, even during the COVID-19 pandemic. To support the ongoing momentum of Universal Code Search and our plans to build Sourcegraph Cloud, we will be hiring in our engineering, sales, product, and marketing departments, more than doubling the size of the company in 2020.

Demand for Sourcegraph is surging because the pandemic has changed how software developers work. Today, the vast majority of software developers are working from home, and even after the current pandemic has passed, it may stay that way as tech companies embrace an all-remote work structure. Developing software remotely will require solutions that boost productivity and allow teams to collaborate effectively. 

Sourcegraph [Universal Code Search](https://about.sourcegraph.com/) is proving to be invaluable for this purpose. With rapidly growing codebases, proliferating numbers of repositories, multiple languages and file formats, and a wide variety of developer tools, developers need a single place to find and fix things across all code, faster. Our customers see us as mission-critical.

Sourcegraph began as a remote-first company, and we transitioned to all-remote in early February 2020 with employees from six continents and one living on an ocean-going catamaran. We are big proponents of developing software at home and the flexibility it gives our teams. This new funding has allowed us to leverage the skills of ultra-talented individuals from companies like Facebook and Google, who will be joining our team.
