[Felicis Ventures](https://www.felicis.com) has invested an additional $5M in Sourcegraph, bringing our total raised to over $46M, including our $23M [Series B](/blog/series-b-universal-code-search) in March 2020. We're seeing rapid growth in the number of companies and developers using Sourcegraph, especially as the pandemic causes dev teams to become temporarily or permanently remote. (If you can't tap your colleague on the shoulder to fix or explain something, or absorb context at the watercooler or whiteboard, universal code search becomes even more important.)

With this momentum and the extra investment, we're accelerating some big things to improve Sourcegraph and get universal code search to every developer:

- Building cloud-hosted universal code search (right now, you need to [self-host Sourcegraph](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/#quickstart) to use it on private code)
- Making virtually all public code searchable on [Sourcegraph Cloud](https://sourcegraph.com/search) by anyone (right now, it only has popular open-source projects)
- TODO: Customer Engineering team to help people spread Sourcegraph to the rest of their company
- TODO: Working with open-source projects to get really good project search
- TODO: Student/university outreach (what Mimi is doing)

We're hiring for many roles (and we're a permanently [all-remote company](TODO)):

- And more (TODO link to careers repo)
