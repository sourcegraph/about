GitHub issue: [#11526](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/11526)

Developer: [Farhan Attamimi](https://github.com/attfarhan)

Sourcegraph 3.18 has added new search pages that scope searches to a collection of repositories. This helps new users coming to Sourcegraph search over
code that is more relevant to them, and introduces them to interesting queries in the process. Many communities will be excited to pick this up and
have pages created specifically for them (e.g. Kubernetes).

Examples include:

- Kubernetes

  > ![K8s search page](https://storage.cloud.google.com/sourcegraph-assets/blog/k8s-search-page.png "K8s search page")

- Python 2 to Python 3 migration examples

  > ![Python search page](https://storage.cloud.google.com/sourcegraph-assets/blog/python-search-page.png "Python search page")

- Golang

  > ![Golang search page](https://storage.cloud.google.com/sourcegraph-assets/blog/golang-search-page.png "Golang search page")

- React Hooks

  > ![React search page](https://storage.cloud.google.com/sourcegraph-assets/blog/react-search-page.png "React search page")

- Android

  > ![Android search page](https://storage.cloud.google.com/sourcegraph-assets/blog/android-search-page.png "Android search page")

...and more to come. If you have suggestions, please [let us know](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/new/choose).
