## Custom search pages on Sourcegraph Cloud (#[11526](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/11526))

Developer: [Farhan](https://github.com/attfarhan)

Sourcegraph 3.18 has added new search pages that scope searches to a collection of repositories. This helps new users coming to Sourcegraph search over
code that is more relevant to them, and introduces them to interesting queries in the process. Many communities will be excited to pick this up and
have pages created specifically for them (e.g. Kubernetes).

Examples include:

* Kubernetes

* Python 2 to Python 3 migration examples
