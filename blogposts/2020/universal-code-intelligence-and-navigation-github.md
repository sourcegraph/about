[Universal Code Intelligence](/product/code-intelligence) means having essential code navigation features such as **hover tooltips**, **go to definition**, and **find references** wherever you read or write code, supporting [every popular language](https://sourcegraph.com/extensions?query=category%3A%22Programming+languages%22), for every public or private repository, on any branch. For GitHub specifically, this means bringing code intelligence to both GitHub Enterprise and GitHub.com.

The **[Sourcegraph browser extension](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/integration/browser_extension)** brings Universal Code Intelligence to GitHub, quickly and for free. It works immediately, and without configuration for open source repositories using [Sourcegraph.com](https://sourcegraph.com/search), and for private repositories with a [self-hosted Sourcegraph instance](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/install).
