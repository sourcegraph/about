The release of Sourcegraph 3.19 happens to coincide with the [one-point-oh release](https://github.com/sourcegraph/lsif-go/releases/tag/v1.0.0) of [lsif-go](https://github.com/sourcegraph/lsif-go). This release boasts impressive speed improvements that brings intelligence to your Go code faster than ever before.

The code intelligence is hard at work trying to bring the _time to intelligence_ - the time between a commit and useful navigation of that code in your Sourcegraph instance - as close to zero as possible. We want your code to always have up-to-date precise code intelligence on the newest commits to help aid you when browsing and reviewing unfamiliar code. Indexing speed is a _huge_ part of this, and we've made a great leap here.

As an illustrative example, checkout the visual difference between indexing our [main repository](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph) with lsif-go v0.9 (above) and indexing it with lsif-go v1.0 (below).

### Performance comparison

Unfortunately, indexing our own code isn't so worthy of celebration. It's a medium-sized repository home to 258k lines of Go code. The old version of the indexer did a fine job at this small scale, even with its many inefficiencies.

What we need to do is go **big**.

Our goal is to _efficiently_ bring code intelligence to the massive engineering teams with a mind-boggling amount of code and a breathtaking frequency of updates to that code. Our goal is to help humans effectively navigate code bases with a constantly changing topology so they can be sure of their footing and concentrate on the task at hand.

So how do we perform at scale?

Much better now, thanks for asking.

In v0.9, it took around 7 1/2 minutes to index the [Go AWS SDK](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go); in v1.0, it takes 24 seconds. In v0.9, it took nearly 7 hours to index 56 million lines of code; in v1.0, it takes under 20 minutes.

**The indexer takes only 5% of the time it used to.**

Indexing speed is _so_ important for code bases undergoing constant change. Stale, hours-old code intelligence on a monorepo at scale is about as useful as using a map of Pangea to find your way home. This is why the code intelligence team is dedicated to [increasing the efficiency of every part of the stack](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/optimizing-a-code-intel-backend) to make sure your maps are always accurate.
