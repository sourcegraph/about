title: "Strange Loop 2019 - Assistive Augmentation: Lip Reading with AI"
description: "In the US alone, approximately 3% of the population (10 million) are either deaf or have moderate to profound hearing loss. This is 3 times as many people than those in wheelchairs yet reasonable disability accommodations for the deaf or hearing impaired only require an ASL (American Sign Language) interpreter in certain circumstances such in official political, legal, education, law enforcement, and employment events and situations. The problem with this is that only a fraction of the functionally deaf (250-500 thousand) speak ASL (also called \"signers\") and situations that have accommodations are few and far in-between anyway so how can the hearing impaired engage with events like the rest of us and especially those that don't have interpreters such as meetups, conferences, and debates."

## Overview

In the US alone, approximately 3% of the population (10 million) are either deaf or have moderate to profound hearing loss. This is 3 times as many people than those in wheelchairs yet reasonable disability accommodations for the deaf or hearing impaired only require an ASL (American Sign Language) interpreter in certain circumstances such in official political, legal, education, law enforcement, and employment events and situations. The problem with this is that only a fraction of the functionally deaf (250-500 thousand) speak ASL (also called \"signers\") and situations that have accommodations are few and far in-between anyway so how can the hearing impaired engage with events like the rest of us and especially those that don't have interpreters such as meetups, conferences, and debates.

AWESOME LIVEBLOG CONTENT HERE!

<!-- Note on images
  Images (e.g. my_image.jpg) should be put in the `website/static/blog/strange-loop-2019` directory, with the path to the image in your post being `/blog/strange-loop-2019/my_image.jpg`. If you'd rather host the images somewhere else for ease of use, that's fine too.

  Please also try to keep your images to a reasonable size by:
    - Using JPEG compression, unless image is mostly solid color 
    - JPEG compression set between 60%-80%
    - Resizing the image to be no wider then 750px
    - If PNG, use a tool like ImageOptim (https://imageoptim.com/mac) to optimize the file size

  I suggest re-sizing and compressing all the images in one batch as a last step.
