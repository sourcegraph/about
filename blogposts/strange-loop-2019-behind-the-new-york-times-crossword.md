description: "The New York Times Crossword is serious business. Operated like a startup within the company, the NYT Games Team works tirelessly to keep our 500,000+ subscribers happily solving while driving significant revenue to support great journalism. With serious solvers comes the need for serious technology. Since rewriting the entire platform in Go and migrating it to a serverless ecosystem, the Games Team has driven innovation at The Times with the most cutting edge tools and infrastructure. Take a behind-the-scenes look of how a puzzle makes it from a constructor to our solvers around the world and the tech challenges we've had to overcome to enable it. See how we've built our games platform to handle immense traffic spikes when new puzzles are released, allow us to fearlessly test in and push changes to production, and quickly launch new games for our subscribers to puzzle over."

## Overview

The New York Times Crossword is serious business. Operated like a startup within the company, the NYT Games Team works tirelessly to keep our 500,000+ subscribers happily solving while driving significant revenue to support great journalism. With serious solvers comes the need for serious technology. Since rewriting the entire platform in Go and migrating it to a serverless ecosystem, the Games Team has driven innovation at The Times with the most cutting edge tools and infrastructure. Take a behind-the-scenes look of how a puzzle makes it from a constructor to our solvers around the world and the tech challenges we've had to overcome to enable it. See how we've built our games platform to handle immense traffic spikes when new puzzles are released, allow us to fearlessly test in and push changes to production, and quickly launch new games for our subscribers to puzzle over.

AWESOME LIVEBLOG CONTENT HERE!

<!-- Note on images
  Images (e.g. my_image.jpg) should be put in the `website/static/blog/strange-loop-2019` directory, with the path to the image in your post being `/blog/strange-loop-2019/my_image.jpg`. If you'd rather host the images somewhere else for ease of use, that's fine too.

  Please also try to keep your images to a reasonable size by:
    - Using JPEG compression, unless image is mostly solid color 
    - JPEG compression set between 60%-80%
    - Resizing the image to be no wider then 750px
    - If PNG, use a tool like ImageOptim (https://imageoptim.com/mac) to optimize the file size

  I suggest re-sizing and compressing all the images in one batch as a last step.
