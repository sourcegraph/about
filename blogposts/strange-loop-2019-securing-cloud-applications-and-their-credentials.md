title: "Strange Loop 2019 - Securing cloud applications and their credentials"
description: "With the rise of containerized cloud-based infrastructure, security in these architectures has been an area that has been often deferred to developers and \"shadow IT\" because the tools and technologies used previously have have not been as quick to catch up. While developers generally make reasonable decisions about securing workloads, pushes for higher velocity end up causing simple implementation misconfigurations that exponentially increase the attack surface. Attendees will learn common container security problems as well as how to increase security of your apps both on the container and scheduler level. We will also cover some of the next-gen tooling and see where long-term security initiatives are heading in this space."

## Overview

With the rise of containerized cloud-based infrastructure, security in these architectures has been an area that has been often deferred to developers and \"shadow IT\" because the tools and technologies used previously have have not been as quick to catch up. While developers generally make reasonable decisions about securing workloads, pushes for higher velocity end up causing simple implementation misconfigurations that exponentially increase the attack surface. Attendees will learn common container security problems as well as how to increase security of your apps both on the container and scheduler level. We will also cover some of the next-gen tooling and see where long-term security initiatives are heading in this space.

AWESOME LIVEBLOG CONTENT HERE!

<!-- Note on images
  Images (e.g. my_image.jpg) should be put in the `website/static/blog/strange-loop-2019` directory, with the path to the image in your post being `/blog/strange-loop-2019/my_image.jpg`. If you'd rather host the images somewhere else for ease of use, that's fine too.

  Please also try to keep your images to a reasonable size by:
    - Using JPEG compression, unless image is mostly solid color 
    - JPEG compression set between 60%-80%
    - Resizing the image to be no wider then 750px
    - If PNG, use a tool like ImageOptim (https://imageoptim.com/mac) to optimize the file size

  I suggest re-sizing and compressing all the images in one batch as a last step.
