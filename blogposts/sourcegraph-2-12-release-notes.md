## Full Changelog (from 2.11 to 2.12)

### Changed

- Reduced the size of in-memory data structures used for storing search results. This should reduce the backend memory usage of large result sets.
- Code intelligence is now provided by [Sourcegraph extensions](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph-extension-api). The extension for each language in the site configuration `langservers` property is automatically enabled.
- Support for multiple authentication providers is now enabled by default. To disable it, set the `experimentalFeatures.multipleAuthProviders` site config option to `"disabled"`. This only applies to Sourcegraph Enterprise.
- When using the `http-header` auth provider, valid auth cookies (from other auth providers that are currently configured or were previously configured) are now respected and will be used for authentication. These auth cookies also take precedence over the `http-header` auth. Previously, the `http-header` auth took precedence.
- Bitbucket Server username configuration is now used to clone repositories if the Bitbucket Server API does not set a username.
- Code discussions: On Sourcegraph.com / when `discussions.abuseProtection` is enabled in the site config, rate limits to thread creation, comment creation, and @mentions are now applied.

### Added

- Search syntax for filtering archived repositories. `archived:no` will exclude archived repositories from search results, `archived:only` will search over archived repositories only. This applies for GitHub and GitLab repositories.
- A Bitbucket Server option to exclude personal repositories in the event that you decide to give an admin-level Bitbucket access token to Sourcegraph and do not want to create a bot account. See https://about.sourcegraph.com/docs/config/repositories/#excluding-personal-repositories for more information.
- Site admins can now see when users of their Sourcegraph instance last used it via a code host integration (e.g. Sourcegraph browser extensions). Visit the site admin Analytics page (e.g. https://sourcegraph.example.com/site-admin/analytics) to view this information.
- A new site config option `extensions.allowRemoteExtensions` lets you explicitly specify the remote extensions (from, e.g., Sourcegraph.com) that are allowed.
- Pings now include a total count of user accounts.
- A new site config option `git.cloneURLToRepositoryName` specifies manual mapping from Git clone URLs to Sourcegraph repository names. This is useful, for example, for Git submodules that have local clone URLs.

### Fixed

- Files with the gitattribute `export-ignore` are no longer excluded for language analysis and search.
- "Discard changes?" confirmation popup doesn't pop up every single time you try to navigate to a new page after editting something in the site settings page anymore.
- Fixed an issue where Git repository URLs would sometimes be logged, potentially containing e.g. basic auth tokens.
- Fixed date formatting on the site admin Analytics page.
- File names of binary and large files are included in search results.
- Slack notifications for saved searches have been fixed.

### Removed

- The deprecated environment variables `SRC_SESSION_STORE_REDIS` and `REDIS_MASTER_ENDPOINT` are no longer used to configure alternative redis endpoints. For more information view the [External Database](https://about.sourcegraph.com/docs/config/external-database) documentation.
