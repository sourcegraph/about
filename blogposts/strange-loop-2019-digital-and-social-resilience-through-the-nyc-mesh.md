## Overview

NYC Mesh is a community-run mesh network that helps over three-hundred homes connect to high-speed Internet; making it one of the largest mesh networks in the world. We work with anyone interested in reclaiming ownership over their Internet, but specifically engage with underserved populations including residents in low-income housing and community centers. Built by a combination of consumer-grade materials and donated fiber-optic cable, this network gives people ownership and control over their Internet usage.

# Digital and Social Resilience through NYC Mesh

Hi everyone! Oh yeah, okay.

Hi everyone, thank yo ufor coming to our talk! My name is Jillian and I'm Michael and we are volunteers at a nonprofit called NYC Mesh

So, this talk is split into two main sections:

We're going to talk about [the highlighted things ]

The second half will be talking about the resilience of the network.

I'm not an  network engineer, I'm going to simplify tings
For the purpose of this tak we'll get halfway tere


The protocols in the internet in a nutshell 

is a network of networks, communicating over protocols. They can be over physical cables or wireless or you can even put thumbdrives or put it in the 
You can transfer data using pigeons 

[ISPs 

They came aobut in the 1980s when everyone wanted to be able to connect to the internet via dialup. After the move of broadband, cable networks had a huge advantage.

Designed for things

The Digital Divide  - separates rich nad poor

This impacts the ability of poor to get access to critical sevices.

Connective in NYC

NYC have "compromised connectivity": most people have only 1 or 2 broadband providers, and still at the mercy of the monopoly.


This map shows off how there is limited connectivity  - red is less connectivity. Manhattan is basically white, while the outer boroughs are much less connected

So NYC Mesh - broadband providers don't offer significant 

"Trust of your internet extends beyond your home, and to the broader community to which you are connected."

---

We dynamically route through nodes rather than traveling through a singular lossy access point. The idea of a mesh network
has been around since the 80s

It's only recent that the tech became cheap, user-friendly enough to allow for true community-owned networks.

---

Example: here's how we can add additional nodes in between to offer more resilience across the nodes

---

We're not alone! Guifi and others run mesh networks around the world. Guifi has 35k active nodes, and they're located in catalonia in spain and they are the gold standard of mesh networks. Catalonia is also famous for grassroots and community organizing.

inspired by 4 tenets

Doing a deep dive into the ways in which NYC Mesh is resilient network and community

---

Decentralized, maintain avery flat organization. Vey conservative to selecting tools. Very sensitive to hidden costs - money spent traveling to install sites, and time costs in complexity.

---

Building a community network

Originally I was excited to work on this alternative internet. People really just wanted a cheap internet, didn't care about the greater mission so much.
 I also believe that building a diverse community is important and that we should make this kind of mesh networking is available to people who are not very technical.

We try to create opportunities for people to highlight their own individual strengths, regardless of whether or not those are technical. Try to encourage people to take leadership roles in areas that align with their passion and vision.

---

Breaking down the barriers to entry

Running an organization this way is really hard - not everyone has the time required to volunteer, how do we keep those people relevant.

We run organizational meetings with frequency. It used to be at a bar - it was very intimidating, etc. We now don't do that any more because it was exclusionary.

---

Our org meeting this month - we had folks from the Queens Digital Tech Lab present, we try to collaborate with other organizations and build community that way.

We try to always leave with a project plan.

A lot of people don't have internet - we try to make sure that all of our materials are accessible both physically and digitaly.

We try to run general classes and talks - try to keep it event and non-profit oriented so as to not scare away people who are intimidated by attending a tech event.

---

There's a mentorship model - Install Leaders take Install Novices with them on node installations. After a number of node installations, Novices get promoted to leaders and can carry on the tradition. This is part of the install leader trainings. There's also a classroom style process where they teach people how to run these installs.

---

These blue dots up at the top are a disconnected node but they're still logically connected to the mesh network via VPN so they can enjoy the benefits of the mesh networks.

---

Photos of new members, happy volunteers. They historically have little to no training and are exciting about where they're connecting to and building a sence of community.


---

We cover a wide variety of buildings: from 4-story walk-ups to entire apartment
complexes. This is the Saratoga node, it's run by the  NYC Housing Authority.

---

This was taken at the St. Francis school for the deaf.

Group Installations are a way for people to get past the idea of the daunting learn  This one on the left had 70 attendees. At least 30% of the people there have been actively engaged in other projects.

---

We're mostly situated in Manhattan and brooklyn.

How do we get connected? People are chomping at the bit. In Queens people have stopped waiting and are just willing to go and build stuff. We are trying to figure out how we're trying to meet that demand for leadership.

Smaller scale group installations in the Greenpoint network - we're getting connectivity and meshing happening in the neighborhood over the summer.

We're getting things going at block parties in BedStuy in brooklyn. We've been speaking  at block parties and getting people interested. We managed to outcompete a neighbroing build-your-own-ice-cream stand.

--- 

People are excited about free internet.

Lucky to be in NYC, get lots of journalism and stuff. People like free or affordable internet.

---

Our outreach surpasses NYC - we have aslack group and there's other people around the country curious about how to build mesh networks. We invite anyone to reach out to the Slack group and stuff. We go to conferences to share things. BattleMesh started off as a big conference of mesh protocols to compete with each other, 

---

We've learned a lot - we're survigin on a small amount of money. We're the only self-sustaining community netowrk. We've been able to scale up volunteers.

We haven't figured out how to structure ourselves as a distributed organization. We're not sure how to secure funding. We don't know how we're oging to be able to hire employees. We're also still really bad at reaching consensus.

---

Once we reach 1k nodes, we might be able to pay some people for their hard work. We'd like to host applications on their netowrk that empower the local communities. **LOOK_HERE**


Thank you!

We can take a few qustions, we are not network engineers.

How does a decentralized organization sign contracts / function with other ISPs?

- We used to be project of the internet society ISOC, and they were the
  fallbacks for that. However it still relied on individuals for that. We're in
the process of applying for a 501c3 so that we can be our own organization.
We're trying really hard to not centralize the organization for this. Specifically, establishing a board has been really tricky.


D you have plans for how to reduce your reliance on ISPs for longer-distance connections?

- Short: no. There'es always going t obe  longer-distnace issues where ISPs are going to be things. Maybe we can join with a regional mesh network. 

- Another issue is being located on backbone, where we're located doesn't have much connectivity.

Do you have a relationship with HUD?

- We try to! NYC is very beauracratic. We're hoping that Saratoga is an experiment in that space, trying to show we're reliable. Howvevr they are already contracting with Sprint.

What's the cost of a typical node install?

- We're ubiquity fanboys, for lightbeams they run about $110. For Hub nodes its about $160. That's for the sector beams that need to travel a few hundred feet.

- We try in our installation price to offer a $50 volunteer fee. We try to subsidise installation fees and help out other people. It's a volunteer thing.

Can you talk about how you patch your network and that sort of thing?

- We're compromisable over physical sitations. We are password protected

Have you had to overcome organized opposition?

- Like...?

We had to tear down in Seattle because it was being part of a camera - so mesh network has a bad taste there.

- No not really

- This is where our education plays into this. How the tech works. We're trying t ocombat the notion that we're just a tool of the police because we're not there at all.

Have you developed strategies to maintain a non-heirarchical organization?

- This is where we tie in to being neighborhood groups. It's definitely challenging. It's still a work in progress.

You siad you're fearing the day that ISPs notice? What happens when the FTC makes this illegal?

- Michael: I don't want to say on camera.

[thunderous applause]

Thank you for coming to this talk!


<!-- Note on images
  Images (e.g. my_image.jpg) should be put in the `website/static/blog/strange-loop-2019` directory, with the path to the image in your post being `/blog/strange-loop-2019/my_image.jpg`. If you'd rather host the images somewhere else for ease of use, that's fine too.

  Please also try to keep your images to a reasonable size by:
    - Using JPEG compression, unless image is mostly solid color 
    - JPEG compression set between 60%-80%
    - Resizing the image to be no wider then 750px
    - If PNG, use a tool like ImageOptim (https://imageoptim.com/mac) to optimize the file size

  I suggest re-sizing and compressing all the images in one batch as a last step.
