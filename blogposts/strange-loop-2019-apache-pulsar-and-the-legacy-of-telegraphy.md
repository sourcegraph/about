title: "Strange Loop 2019 - Apache Pulsar and the Legacy of Telegraphy"
description: "The Wireless Telegraph was invited in the 1890s and quickly spread to be the dominant method of peer-to-peer communication throughout the 19th century. As a method of communication, the Telegraph allowed for a secure, Intercontinental, high-throughput and extensible message transmission. Toward the end of its popularity, Telegraphs were a broadcast protocol (one sender to many recipients), and their utility skyrocketed. The design considerations and engineering of the Telegraph are seen in contemporary messaging systems, especially Apache Pulsar. This talk covers the design considerations required to enabled globally distributed, low-latency applications to run on top of Apache Pulsar. From the storage model to replication and deployment, I explore each of these design decisions and how they contrast with the design of wireless telegraphy. The talk concludes with a demo of Apache Pulsar functions and Pulsar SQL, displaying the extensibility of Pulsar. Attendees can expect to learn a brief history of wireless telegraphy and a deep understanding of the design of Apache Pulsar."

## Overview

The Wireless Telegraph was invited in the 1890s and quickly spread to be the dominant method of peer-to-peer communication throughout the 19th century. As a method of communication, the Telegraph allowed for a secure, Intercontinental, high-throughput and extensible message transmission. Toward the end of its popularity, Telegraphs were a broadcast protocol (one sender to many recipients), and their utility skyrocketed. The design considerations and engineering of the Telegraph are seen in contemporary messaging systems, especially Apache Pulsar. This talk covers the design considerations required to enabled globally distributed, low-latency applications to run on top of Apache Pulsar. From the storage model to replication and deployment, I explore each of these design decisions and how they contrast with the design of wireless telegraphy. The talk concludes with a demo of Apache Pulsar functions and Pulsar SQL, displaying the extensibility of Pulsar. Attendees can expect to learn a brief history of wireless telegraphy and a deep understanding of the design of Apache Pulsar.

AWESOME LIVEBLOG CONTENT HERE!

<!-- Note on images
  Images (e.g. my_image.jpg) should be put in the `website/static/blog/strange-loop-2019` directory, with the path to the image in your post being `/blog/strange-loop-2019/my_image.jpg`. If you'd rather host the images somewhere else for ease of use, that's fine too.

  Please also try to keep your images to a reasonable size by:
    - Using JPEG compression, unless image is mostly solid color 
    - JPEG compression set between 60%-80%
    - Resizing the image to be no wider then 750px
    - If PNG, use a tool like ImageOptim (https://imageoptim.com/mac) to optimize the file size

  I suggest re-sizing and compressing all the images in one batch as a last step.
