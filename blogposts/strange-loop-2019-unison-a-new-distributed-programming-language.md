It began as an experiment: rethink all aspects of the programming experience, including the core language, runtime, tooling, as well as code versioning and publishing, and then do whatever is necessary to eliminate needless complexity and make building software once again delightful, or at the very least, reasonable."

## Overview

Unison is an open source functional programming language with special support for building distributed, elastic systems. It began as an experiment: rethink all aspects of the programming experience, including the core language, runtime, tooling, as well as code versioning and publishing, and then do whatever is necessary to eliminate needless complexity and make building software once again delightful, or at the very least, reasonable.

AWESOME LIVEBLOG CONTENT HERE!

<!-- Note on images
  Images (e.g. my_image.jpg) should be put in the `website/static/blog/strange-loop-2019` directory, with the path to the image in your post being `/blog/strange-loop-2019/my_image.jpg`. If you'd rather host the images somewhere else for ease of use, that's fine too.

  Please also try to keep your images to a reasonable size by:
    - Using JPEG compression, unless image is mostly solid color 
    - JPEG compression set between 60%-80%
    - Resizing the image to be no wider then 750px
    - If PNG, use a tool like ImageOptim (https://imageoptim.com/mac) to optimize the file size

  I suggest re-sizing and compressing all the images in one batch as a last step.
