## Overview

My foray into Go began a few years ago when I started working at DigitalOcean. While building an abstraction layer on top of Kubernetes and familiarizing myself with the language, I began to love it. Syntactically simple, with amazing concurrency primitives and a wonderful community, Go was an excellent choice for a cloud-hosting company with a variety of low-level, server-side microservices.

AWESOME LIVEBLOG CONTENT HERE!

<!-- Note on images
  Images (e.g. my_image.jpg) should be put in the `website/static/blog/strange-loop-2019` directory, with the path to the image in your post being `/blog/strange-loop-2019/my_image.jpg`. If you'd rather host the images somewhere else for ease of use, that's fine too.

  Please also try to keep your images to a reasonable size by:
    - Using JPEG compression, unless image is mostly solid color 
    - JPEG compression set between 60%-80%
    - Resizing the image to be no wider then 750px
    - If PNG, use a tool like ImageOptim (https://imageoptim.com/mac) to optimize the file size

  I suggest re-sizing and compressing all the images in one batch as a last step.
