Sourcegraph 3.29 is now available! For this release, we introduced search results ranking, made it easier to create Code Insights, and added support for bulk actions with Batch Changes.

## Search results ranking

We're making search results more relevant, starting with better prioritization of repos vs. code in your search results. Search results and suggestions are now ranked by descending star count on sourcegraph.com and customer instances (for repos with stars), making it easier to find specific repos. Start searching on sourcegraph.com to experience the new ranking.

## New visual design for the Sourcegraph UI

We are proud to bring you an entirely new visual design for the Sourcegraph UI. The new visual design was developed to help users find references, troubleshoot errors, gain insight, make changes on a massive scale, and read code. Check out our recent blog post to [learn more about the new Sourcegraph UI](/blog/introducing-sourcegraphs-new-ui/).

## Code Insights

### One-click Code Insights creation from your search

 </video></p>

You can now create code insights with one click, right from the search query view. Take your search query and turn it into a visualization of your results count in your code over time, to see if your usage of an API, function, or other target is growing or shrinking.

### Improved creation forms for Code Insights

 </video></p>

We now autosuggest and autocomplete the repository field in the correct format. The forms also now autosave your configuration, in case you navigate away before you hit "create." (You can clear your existing autosave if you want to start fresh, with the "clear all fields" button.)

## Batch Changes

### New bulk actions: retry and merge (experimental)

Last release we introduced [bulk actions](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/release/3.28/#Batch-changes), allowing users to comment on hundreds of changesets in a few clicks. We've added two more bulk actions in this release: retry errored changesets and merge.

Merge is released as an experimental feature. It supports merge commit and squash merge on GitHub and GitLab, and merge commit on Bitbucket. For example, you can now filter all changesets that have passed checks and review, and merge them all in a few clicks. [Read more about bulk operations](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/batch_changes/how-tos/bulk_operations_on_changesets#supported-types-of-bulk-operations).
