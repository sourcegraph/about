Sourcegraph 3.34 is now available! For this release, we introduced:

## No results page
When your search comes back with no results it can sometimes be hard to know why. We now display helpful tips on how to use search, examples of how to solve common query issues, and links to help videos addressing common use cases.

## Find Implementations for Go
Navigating to implementations is now available for Go! If you have precise code intelligence enabled for your Go repositories, you can now click on Find Implementations to navigate to a symbol's interface definition. If you're at the interface definition itself, clicking on Find Implementations will show all the places where the interface is being implemented, allowing you to explore how it's being used by other users across repositories. It will also show you which interfaces a struct implements.

# 3.34.0
# Added
  - description: "Added the \"no results page\", a help page providing search tips if a search returns no results."
    url: https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/26154
    category: Search
  - description: "The search indexer only polls repositories that have been marked as changed. This significantly reduces load on the Git server in installations with many repositories. If you notice index staleness, you can try disabling by setting the environment variable `SRC_SEARCH_INDEXER_EFFICIENT_POLLING_DISABLED` on `sourcegraph-frontend`."

  - description: "Added logging of incoming Batch Changes webhooks to help site admins debug issues with webhook delivery. By default, sites without encryption will log webhooks for three days and sites with encryption will not log webhooks.

# Changed
  - description: "Batch Changes now requests the `workflow` scope on GitHub personal access tokens to allow batch changes to write to the `.github` directory in repositories. If you have already configured a GitHub PAT for use with Batch Changes, we suggest adding the scope to the others already granted."

    category: Batch Changes
  - description: "The search UI's repositories count as well as the GraphQL API's `search().repositories` and `search().repositoriesCount` have changed semantics from the set of searchable repositories to the set of repositories with matches. In a future release, we'll introduce separate fields for the set of searchable repositories backed by a [scalable implementation](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/27274)."

    category:
  - description: "Fixed a regression that was introduced in 3.27 and broke SSH-based authentication for managing Batch Changes changesets on code hosts. SSH keys generated by Sourcegraph were not used for authentication and authenticating with the code host would fail if no SSH key with write-access had been added to `gitserver`."
