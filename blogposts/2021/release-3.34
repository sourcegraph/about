  - description: "The search indexer only polls repositories that have been marked as changed. This significantly reduces load on the Git server in installations with many repositories. If you notice index staleness, you can try disabling by setting the environment variable `SRC_SEARCH_INDEXER_EFFICIENT_POLLING_DISABLED` on `sourcegraph-frontend`."

Sourcegraph 3.34 is now available! Here are some highlights from this release:

## Troubleshoot your searches with the "no results" page
Searches that return no results can often result in a confusing experience for users. When this occurs, we now display helpful tips on how to use search, examples of how to solve common query issues, and links to tutorial videos addressing common use cases.

## Quickly navigate your Go code with Find Implementations
Navigating to implementations is now available for Go! If you have precise code intelligence enabled for your Go repositories, you can now click on Find Implementations to navigate to a symbol's interface definition. If you're at the interface definition itself, clicking on Find Implementations will show all the places where the interface is being implemented, allowing you to explore how it's being used by other users across repositories. It will also show you which interfaces a struct implements.
