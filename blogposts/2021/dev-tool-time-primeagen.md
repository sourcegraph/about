As a popular Twitch streamer and Vim enthusiast, ThePrimeagen is known for his fast-paced tmux and Neovim focused workflow, shifting quickly between windows, buffers, and code chunks. When he joined us for [Dev Tool Time](https://info.sourcegraph.com/dev-tool-time) on October 27, 2021, he shared his approach to reducing cognitive overhead in his dev workflow, and showed how his custom configurations make it easier to think less and do more.

You can watch the recording of this episode at the [bottom of this blog post](#Watch-the-recording), but first let’s check out ThePrimeagen’s desk setup:
