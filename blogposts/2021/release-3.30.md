Sourcegraph 3.30 is now available! For this release, we introduced:

## Batch Changes: Publish and unpublish changesets from the GUI

Batch Changes features a powerful idempotent [spec-based workflow](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/batch_changes/explanations/batch_changes_design), where the spec file defines the batch change. In particular, the [`published`](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/batch_changes/references/batch_spec_yaml_reference#changesettemplate-published) property defines if changesets are published to the codehost or not.

This workflow is great for reproducibility and having a completely CLI-based workflow, and we are keeping it!

_In addition_, we are allowing changesets to be published and unpublished directly from the GUI, to make the workflow more approachable to new users. Simply omit the `published` field in the specs, and the GUI will become the source of truth for publishing changesets.

## Code Insights dashboards

You can now add your code insights to individual dashboard pages, in order to group and share a contextual subset of all created insights. Dashboards can have one of three possible visibility scopes: private, users in your organization, or global. For more on dashboards, [see the docs](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_insights/explanations/viewing_code_insights#insights-dashboards).

## New code search reference

We've added a new search reference to the search results sidebar. The search reference lists search filters which can be expanded to display documentation and examples. The reference can be used to learn about filters or as a shortcut to using the filters in queries.

## Introducing API docs

Try out our brand new experimental feature that builds on top of Sourcegraph's semantic understanding of your code to analyze and generate API documentation. We're starting with Go and would love to hear from you what language we should tackle next.

Read the [Sneak peek: API documentation generated for all your code](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/api-documentation-for-all-your-code/) blog post for more details.
