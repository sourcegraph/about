Joining a new team is pretty exhilarating: tackling new codebases, learning interdependencies and systems, and collaborating with new teammates to bring different products to life.
But the learning curve can be daunting, confusing, and even debilitating, not only undermining developers’ skills and ambitions as new team members, but delaying their ability to contribute to the bigger picture.

We’re taking a deep dive into best practices for software engineer onboarding and, as a critical point of entry, we want to know what’s working to get new developers feeling productive, safe, and able to contribute meaningfully and quickly.

## How Big Code creates big problems for software engineer onboarding

With the rise of Big Code—that is, how code is growing in volume, variety, velocity, and value—in all industries, new developers are feeling its influence across the board.
In a 2020 survey of software professionals, the top-cited challenge due to the dramatic rise in code complexity was the time and effort for new hires to be productive.
But why does the emergence of these sprawling, complex codebases create big problems for new software developers? And what’s a better path forward?

If we think of the era of Big Code in terms of the massive growth in the volume and complexity of code that teams are required to manage in the hyper-specific, and possibly imperfect, systems within any organization, this creates an ad hoc environment for us to navigate—without guidance, standards, and tools to keep things in sync with our new teams and leadership.
But every new workplace is different, and code overload can mean different things in different environments.
Not only are new team members just trying to understand the code, they’re trying to learn how the company uniquely structures and thinks about its code.
[Marek Zaluski](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/company/team#marek-zaluski), a developer education engineer here at Sourcegraph, noted, “The biggest challenges are getting familiar with what’s already there. The bigger it is, the more difficulty there is.”
And without effective code search or support, you end up dividing your hours into learning and researching new codebases, and then actually implementing them.

## Codebase overwhelm can lead to anxiety and self-doubt

A whopping 94% of survey respondents report that their organization is affected by Big Code, regardless of industry or the number of developers on their team, with a variety of challenges getting new developers up to speed.
Almost everyone is now onboarding into a Big Code environment, and under its umbrella falls increasing testing metrics, incident handling, operational monitoring...
But the consequences of Big Code on onboarding software engineers are two-fold: it requires both technical onboarding, as well as a cultural one.
Not only does being thrown in the deep end result in wasted time and productivity, but it also instills anxiety and fear—which cycles back to mistakes, searching code in silo with personally resourced tools, distressed work environments, and piecemeal feedback that doesn’t lead to structural change.

Even when they’re well qualified for the job, new developers will have moments of self-doubt and impostor syndrome. “In the past, I’ve been in situations where I’m thrown into a new project and expected to figure it out.
It’s stressful, and the bigger the codebase, the more anxiety I have. It’s hard to even know where to start,” said Marek.
[Adam Harvey](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/company/team#adam-harvey), another developer here at Sourcegraph said, “Culture becomes important. You want the space to make mistakes when you’re coming into a new environment. You want a combination of psychological safety (knowing that your team won’t throw you under the bus) and technical safety (guardrails to know that you won’t make a huge mistake for a customer).”
Marek agreed, saying “Part of psychological safety is knowing that asking questions is encouraged. You can start to feel isolated if you’re worried about bothering your fellow engineers by asking questions that seem too simple.”

## How engineering managers can implement better onboarding

Repeatable, scalable onboarding that continually raises the curve is an ongoing and collaborative effort. Here's how to go about it:

### Get everyone involved

Everyone, not just recruiters and HR, contributes to a great onboarding experience. Adam noted, “The philosophy is that we’re all on one team, which requires buy-in from everyone to put in the time and effort to support each other.
Our new hires are told by the CEO that we’ll drop everything to help with any questions they have. This sets a strong signal across the company that it’s not just platitudes, but a priority.”
But he added that setting the tone is not enough, and pointed to implementing set meetings to help unblock people, regardless of whether they’re new to the team or just stuck.

### Make it safe to ask for help

Our developers say that setting timers for new hires can help: if they aren’t making progress in 15 minutes, encourage them to ask a teammate so they’re not taking a full day trying to figure out how to do something.
And that they know this is welcomed and okay. Because we’re fully remote at Sourcegraph, we also employ an onboarding buddy system, pairing people who usually aren’t in the same department, which can help measure how your team dynamic fits into the rest of the company.

### Have a single source of truth

Ongoing documentation, shared resources, open access, and keeping everything a new developer needs to know in a single source of truth (such as your company handbook or project management tool) helps address the complexity and volume of your org’s codebases.
Having all the information in one place reduces the anxiety of not knowing where to find everything, and lets new developers swiftly learn, communicate, and execute against clear goals.

“Once you’re knowledgeable of a codebase, it’s difficult to put yourself in the shoes of a new developer, knowing where to start, identifying interdependencies, connections and managing libraries,” says Marek.
Having a centralized system with clear documentation helps distribute knowledge equally.

Sometimes being lost isn’t just a discovery problem, but a social one. If you asked a group of engineers which databases to use, you might get multiple answers. Clear communication, guidance, and standards builds a transparent and safe environment to know how much knowledge you’re still missing before you can fully participate and contribute.
Adam added, “A huge part of onboarding into a Big Code environment is how we interact with each other, and learn how to navigate through systems like operational monitoring, testing, or incident handling with reasonable confidence.

### Make sure everyone is using the same resources and tools

Marek stated, “Sometimes when you’re reaching for a particular tool or library, you don’t even know if you have something in-house already or if you need to look externally.
Codesearch makes it easier to look through your list of repositories to find what others have done.” Ensuring it’s clear what tools are available and in use helps new developers quickly find their footing, familiarizing themselves with codebases and coding conventions and eliminating the need to start from scratch every time.

Successful software engineer onboarding doesn’t just affect the quality of the work, but pushes a company forward by integrating new hires as an essential, valuable part of a team, significantly decreasing the time for new developers to be productive, motivated, and feel fulfilled in their work.
Solving for the issues inherent with the emergence of Big Code, together, is a vital part of it.

Growing a software engineering team poses unique challenges. You’re onboarding software engineers who weren't witness to the evolution of the codebase, or privy to the discussions and debates around critical design decisions.
They aren't aware of why you added many of the features and logic—some hackier than the rest.
They may not even be familiar with the general toolset that your team has come to rely on to work efficiently.

## 3 engineering leaders on software engineer onboarding

Great companies invest a great deal of effort into helping new software engineers onboard to their codebases.
Now, we'll take a deep dive with engineering leaders from 3 highly reputed engineering organizations to understand how they structure their software engineer onboarding, and how they address specific challenges in order to support their new hires and help them ramp up as quickly as possible.

[Limor Bergman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/limorbergman/) is a former Director of Engineering at Digital Ocean, where she led the organizations responsible for Droplets, Kubernetes, Kernel, Performance, Systems, and Orchestration.
She's now Director of Mentorship at PowerToFly, where she helps women grow their careers.

[Ryan Djurovich](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryandjurovich/) is a DevOps Manager at Xero, Australia's largest accounting software company.
He leads the team responsible for developer infrastructure, experience, and tooling.

[Jean du Plessis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeandp/) is a Director of Engineering at Sourcegraph, where he leads the Developer Insights organization, which includes the frontend platform, extensibility, code insights, and API docs teams.

The 3 offered their thoughts on the process of onboarding software engineers to the team, revealing some strong parallels as well as some particular areas of emphasis and focus.

## Help new hires see the bigger picture with multi-tiered onboarding

Multi-tiered onboarding provides a layered, holistic view of the organization.

All 3 engineering leaders described a multi-tier onboarding process with steps common across the organization and ones specific to the new hire's immediate team.
Some things should be standard across the organization: setting up and familiarizing oneself with shared collaboration tools (email, chat, issue tracker, code review, CI/CD) and understanding the "big picture" of what the company does and how the various organizations interact with each other.
At Digital Ocean, department heads would give recurring presentations attended by every batch of new hires about how each department operated.

Individual teams should also think about how to onboard new members to the things that are specific to the team, such as setting up the development environment that members of the team use, meeting and establishing relationships with teammates, and understanding what’s necessary to ship that first bug fix or feature enhancement.

## Share high-level context

High-level context is the hardest to transfer. It’s difficult to document, because grokking the overall architecture means understanding how the pieces fit together and knowing what the core assumptions and tension points are. Even if you do a reasonable job with the documentation, chances are it will fall out of date.
However, it's important to transfer such knowledge, including historical knowledge. Otherwise you can get into a position where no one is left on the team who feels confident making big changes, not just small, incremental ones. As Jean said in our conversation, context is king, so don't underestimate the importance of giving people the proper context, because it's better to spend more time upfront to enable people to move much more quickly down the road.

Having a source of truth that captures not just code changes, but high-level discussions about the motivation behind changes is important, because it preserves the "why" for new members of the team who may need to understand it at some point down the road. Jean shared: "This exact scenario played out for a new engineer recently. They love context and understanding the history behind decisions.
Thankfully, Sourcegraph has this practice of putting [Requests for Comments (RFCs)](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/communication/rfcs) together when we want to introduce any changes or make architectural decisions.
We were able to refer to this document, which even predates my time, that gave context on these decisions. Because even the people who worked on it at the time eventually forget about it."

Limor shared that putting new hires into an on-call rotation can also help them get oriented, because diagnosing and addressing outages will require them to understand the system end to end.
During on-call, when they're not resolving an issue, they should be updating the docs based on the last thing they just resolved.

[Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/search) and [CodeTour](https://github.com/microsoft/codetour) are both useful tools that enable people to build up their own context in a codebase.
This helps them acquire more context on their own and ask smarter questions of their teammates.

## Avoid one-size-fits all software engineer onboarding

Good software engineer onboarding often requires tailoring the experience to a new hire's specific strengths, experience, and personality.

> "I think as a new engineer onboarding, you're a little bit of an adventurer; you're going into uncharted territory.
> What you want to do as a manager is allow them some freedom to explore because that process leads to learning and discovery, but you also want to set them up for success.
> So you want to give them a map—that could be your architecture documents. You want to make sure they have the right gear, so that could be making sure they have the right software and a laptop and all of that.
> And you would probably give them a satellite phone as well if they really get stuck out in the wilderness, so they can call for help.
> That might be the team that is there to support them or an onboarding buddy who gives them guidance along the way.
> Something that means they can call a friend if they really get stuck." – Jean

Standardization and automation should take place for the common things, mostly in the form of checklists and documentation, but it's also important to leave room for the "satellite phone" so a new hire can call in for help from a more experienced teammate.
This is especially important in fast-moving companies, because the codebase always moves faster than docs and automation.

You don’t want to waste long-time engineers’ time answering questions that can be linked to a doc, but you must be careful not to reinforce a culture over time where people don't make themselves available to new hires when they _do_ need facetime with an experienced human.
Onboarding Slack channels can help reveal gaps in onboarding knowledge to everyone, but be wary of everyone spending time to address simple questions.
Some new hires may also feel intimidated to ask questions to a wide forum.

The engineering manager (EM) plays a crucial role here. Jean said one EM spent an hour daily with a new hire to answer high-level questions. This led to one of the fastest onboardings he has seen, where the new engineer was able to drive a significant change in their first month on the job.

COVID also made it much easier _not_ to have 1-1 conversations with people, so EMs may want to explicitly schedule extra 1-1 time with new hires. Ryan puts this time on the calendar, but leaves people the option to cancel at their discretion:

> "Sometimes we set the expectation that we're going to meet every time. But at other times it's, 'Hey, this is us making our time available to you, but you choose if you want to have this or not.'
> Some people have opted for a lot of sessions, and come with a list of questions, and that's how they prefer to learn.
> Others prefer to find information asynchronously through Slack or Confluence or whatnot."

Experience level also affects how new hires onboard. Junior engineers likely need more guidance and also reassurance about what is a "normal pace" of onboarding.
That's not to discount the benefit of reassurance for senior engineers, as well, but it's customary to expect a senior engineer starts directing their own onboarding after getting through the standard stuff.

## Offer emotional support

Even senior engineers can suffer from impostor syndrome. Nearly everyone feels intimidated when diving into a new large codebase.
Finding the right balance between past experience and new territory is crucial, and organizations that value this should go out of their way to create a welcoming culture and environment.

For new hires, having a marker for "am I living up to expectations" in the first couple of weeks can ease their worries.
It's often better to err on the side of having an easier onramp, due to all the pitfalls of onboarding.
This also allows an EM to establish a baseline for how a new hire works and what they're capable of.
If you overshoot, you'll be unsure if it's a performance issue or if the person just happened to fail due to unreasonably tough circumstances.

Remember, you hired someone because you thought they were excellent. So if they are struggling, you should figure out what might be throwing them off, or revisit your hiring processes if this is happening often.
It's common for fast-growing startups to experience some churn and attrition, but if this is happening a lot, it's important for someone in the org to be asking these questions and sharing as much learning as they can while respecting individual privacy.

## Embrace continuous onboarding

> "I think most people look at onboarding in the same way we look at education: you go to school, you graduate, and you're done with learning.
> But the reality is you should never be done with learning. And in the same way, when it comes to onboarding onto codebases and infrastructure and that kind of thing, you should never be done with learning there because those systems aren't in a consistent state; they're evolving over time as the business evolves." – Ryan

Onboarding isn't just something that happens when a developer joins a new company. Our job as developers entails continually diving into new areas of code and learning what makes things tick, so in some sense, we never stop onboarding. This is especially true when we switch teams or start a new project on a very unfamiliar part of the codebase.
There are some things they already know and don't need to repeat—for example, they likely already have the dev environment set up and have the big picture of the overall company—but there is still a lot of context to acquire.
Therefore, investing in good software engineer onboarding can be an investment in the overall velocity of development, because in some sense, devs are continuously onboarding to new domains of knowledge.
Onboarding is part of the job description.

## Onboarding now and then

In talking to engineering leaders who have been in the industry for awhile, it becomes apparent that many things have become more complex about software development over time. Software systems are serving more users, dealing with greater volumes of data, and provide more integrations and pieces of functionality than ever before. The amount of code in the world is increasing, and so has the size of the average codebase.
It can sometimes be tempting to yearn for the way things were when codebases were smaller and less interconnected—before the advent of distributed systems, of big complex web applications, of software permeating every company.
Tooling has gotten much better and more advanced over time, but it feels like it's just catching up with the challenges of developing software at scale. You can no longer just attach a debugger to a single process to figure out what's going on in production, and you can no longer rely on local search to cover all the code that makes up your application.

Having a robust onboarding process, that is both standard/automated and human/supportive is as important as ever.
This is especially true when you consider how quickly the number of developers in the world is growing.
If we truly want to create a world where the vast majority of people contribute to the code economy, we are going to do it one onboarding at a time.

A parting tip from Limor: "Don't be ashamed of admitting you don't know or understand something—just ask.
Some new hires are more proactive go-getters: they ask, they try to reach out. Some people don’t have the confidence and they don’t ask.
It's okay not to know! It's okay not to understand, especially when you're just starting out. Just go and ask and look for people who can help you."
