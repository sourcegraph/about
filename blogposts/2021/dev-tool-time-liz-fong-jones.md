Intro paragraph

## Primary desk setup

ARM64 box

![Liz's main work desk]()

## Accessibility

Acessibility in two senses:
1. physical accessibility - Chronic fatigue, uses 2017 [Google Pixelbook](https://support.google.com/pixelbook/answer/7503982?hl=en) due to its light weight -> Makes it easy to use from bed, holding it up with a pinky. 

![Liz's reclined work setup]()

2. minimalism - tools that are accessible across devices with different levels of computing power - prime example is [nano editor](https://www.nano-editor.org/), but also default config powerline and use of Bash.

## Observability

Tools: Honeycomb, CircleCI, launchdarkly

video: "Honeycomb Observability.mp4"

Part of observability is automation of builds and configuration of infrastructue: Chef, Terraform

## Sustainability

> “You heard it first at Dev Tool Time: 'The future is Linux on the desktop on top of ARM64.'”

ARM64 as energy efficient, performant
