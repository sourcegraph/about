title: "GopherCon 2019 - Optimization for number of goroutines using feedback control"
description: "The design for the number of concurrency is important to achieve both speed and stability. To give a good performance without depending on platform and load conditions, it’s desirable for the number to be dynamic and rapidly controlled. In this talk, I will propose an architecture to solve this by utilizing feedback control."

## Overview

The design for the number of concurrency is important to achieve both speed and stability. To give a good performance without depending on platform and load conditions, it’s desirable for the number to be dynamic and rapidly controlled. In this talk, I will propose an architecture to solve this by utilizing feedback control.
