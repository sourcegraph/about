We're excited to be the official liveblogging partner for GraphQL Summit 2017!

The Sourcegraph team and esteemed members of the community will be writing up concise technical summaries of as many of the amazing talks by GraphQL experts this year as we can. For folks tuning in from home, the liveblog will be a great way to stay on top of conference proceedings efficiently throughout the day. For folks at the conference, it's a great way to remind yourself of the key takeaways of each talk. See our [liveblogging coverage of GopherCon 2017](https://about.sourcegraph.com/go) for an example of what to expect.

For those of you lucky enough to be at the conference, stop by and say hello (we are in a small table in the main room). And for those of you at home, keep your social media antenna pointed to https://twitter.com/srcgraph or go to https://about.sourcegraph.com/graphql.
