Sourcegraph 3.39 is now available! In this release:

## Dependencies search now supports GO

Dependencies search beta feature announced in our 3.38 release now supports searching your GO dependencies.

## Code Insights is no longer backed by Timescale

Code Insights can now be used with managed database solutions that do not support [Timescale](https://www.timescale.com/), and it now uses native Postgres. 

This migration has been applied over 3.37 and 3.38, and should be seamless if you are running infrastructure as described by the [official Sourcegraph deployment repositories](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:%40sourcegraph/all+repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph+select:repo&patternType=literal). If you have a customized deployment, you may need to incorporate some changes into your configuration ([more details and examples here](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/32271#issuecomment-1086328666)).

Any managed database solution that supports the [official Sourcegraph Postgres version requirements](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/postgres#version-requirements) is now suitable for Code Insights. Migration from a self-hosted database is not performed automatically, and will need to be performed by a Sourcegraph admin at your own discretion.
