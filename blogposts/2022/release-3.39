Sourcegraph 3.39 is now available! In this release:

## Onboard developers fast with Notebooks, now Generally Available

Built with onboarding in mind, Notebooks make documentation effortless, stable, and fun. Inspired by the Jupyter Notebooks project and featuring four unique block types, an intelligent notepad for creating notebooks on the fly, and deep integration with Sourcegraph's code search so you can always find the code you need.

!["Notebooks overview"](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/notebooks/notebooks_overview_release_post.mp4)

Web-based notebooks are the easiest way to create and share notebooks with your team or company, but we also support file-based notebooks via a special `.snb.md` file type. With file-based Notebooks, you can augment existing documentation and meet where your developers where they already are. You can also embed notebooks on any web page, enabling easy integration with your knowledge management systems.

Explore [public notebooks on sourcegraph.com](https://sourcegraph.com/notebooks?tab=explore) (no account required to view; create a free account to build your own) or get started creating your own at `https://{your-sourcegraph-url}/notebooks`!

To learn all about Notebooks, [read the docs](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/notebooks)!

## Code Insights is no longer backed by Timescale

Code Insights can now be used with managed database solutions that do not support [Timescale](https://www.timescale.com/), like Amazon RDS. It now uses native Postgres.

This migration has been applied over 3.37 and 3.38, and should be seamless if you are running infrastructure as described by the [official Sourcegraph deployment repositories](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:%40sourcegraph/all+repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph+select:repo&patternType=literal). If you have a customized deployment, you may need to incorporate some changes into your configuration ([more details and examples here](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/32271#issuecomment-1086328666)).

Any managed database solution that supports the [official Sourcegraph Postgres version requirements](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/postgres#version-requirements) is now suitable for Code Insights. Migration from a self-hosted database is not performed automatically, and will need to be performed by a Sourcegraph admin at your own discretion.

## Improved search-based local navigation for Java

We've added tree-sitter to our search-based Code Intelligence to make our local navigation for Java faster and more precise.

## Search your Go dependenices

[Dependencies search](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search/how-to/dependencies_search) allows you to quickly search through your repository dependencies for faster incident and vulnerability resolution. Dependencies search now supports Go dependencies in addition to NPM.
