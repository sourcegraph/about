[Sourcegraph](https://about.sourcegraph.com/) is the standard developer platform for code search and navigation at many of the largest and most exacting technology companies. With Sourcegraph, every company has access to the same kind of tools that Google and Facebook developers use every day.

## Sourcegraph plugin provides native code intelligence to Bitbucket Server

TO DO: VIDEO

    <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/{ID}?color=0CB6F4&amp;title=0&amp;byline=" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

Admins can now install the [Sourcegraph for Bitbucket Server plugin](https://github.com/sourcegraph/bitbucket-server-plugin) on their Bitbucket Server instance to provide code intelligence automatically to their teams. Code intelligence, previously available only through the browser extension, includes hovers, tooltips, and line decorations while browsing and reviewing code in Bitbucket Server.

Previously, many users were not aware of the Sourcegraph browser extension. Now, admins can provide an easier onboarding path for all team members who want to browse or review code on Bitbucket Server.

There are two configuration steps:

1. Install the [Sourcegraph for Bitbucket Server plugin](https://github.com/sourcegraph/bitbucket-server-plugin)
2. Update the [Bitbucket Server external service configuration](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/external_service/bitbucket_server#native-extension) in your Sourcegraph instance to include `‚ÄùcorsOrigin‚Äù: ‚Äú<bitbucket server url>‚Äù`

## 30% indexed search latency improvement for small and medium instances

![chart showing 30% improvement of search latency](images/3.6-search-latency.png "30% improvement of search latency")

We have made several changes to our search algorithm that improve performance and reduce peak memory usage. Our benchmarks show that the **99th percentile latency** of indexed searches in small to medium instances (less than 3000 repositories) **is reduced by up to 30%**. We will be continuing work to further benchmark and optimize Sourcegraph for our customers with 30,000+ repositories.

## Add quick links to repositories or important resources below the search bar

TO DO: VIDEO

<!--
<p class="container">
  <div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;">
    <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/{ID}?color=0CB6F4&amp;title=0&amp;byline=" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
  </div>
  <p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://vimeo.com/{ID}" target="_blank">View on Vimeo</a></p>
</p>
-->

[Quick links](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/user/quick_links) can now be added below the search bar on the home page and search results page. This makes it easier for teams to quickly access the Sourcegraph pages they care most about such as your team‚Äôs main repository, or have easy access to external resources like your CI system or team documentation.

Add a quick link to global, organization, or user settings with the `quicklinks` field:

```
{
  // ...
  "quicklinks": [
    {
      "name": "Sourcegraph docs",
      "url": "https://docs.sourcegraph.com"
    },
    {
      "name": "Main repository",
      "url": "/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph"
    }
  ]
  // ...
}
```

## Added support for Bitbucket Cloud external service configuration

TO DO: VIDEO

<!--
<p class="container">
  <div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;">
    <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/{ID}?color=0CB6F4&amp;title=0&amp;byline=" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
  </div>
  <p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://vimeo.com/{ID}" target="_blank">View on Vimeo</a></p>
</p>
-->

Previously, Bitbucket Cloud repositories had to be added and configured as individual git repositories. In Sourcegraph 3.6 we added first class support for connecting [Bitbucket Cloud repositories](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/external_service/bitbucket_cloud). In this release, all repositories will be added for the username configured, and teams listed that the Bitbucket Cloud app password grants access to.

## Improved external service configuration and syncing experience for admins

TO DO: Updated video (should we mark the 3.5 video as deprecated?)

<!--
<p class="container">
  <div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;">
    <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/{ID}?color=0CB6F4&amp;title=0&amp;byline=" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
  </div>
  <p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://vimeo.com/{ID}" target="_blank">View on Vimeo</a></p>
</p>
-->

Admins no longer have to wait for an external service to finish syncing before navigating away from the configuration page. Previously, this was problematic for customers adding external services with lots of repositories. Now, the syncing continues in the background and progress is shown to admins in the global navigation bar‚Äôs syncing status indicator.

The experimental repository syncing status indicator announced in 3.5 has been improved enough to turn this feature on for all site admins by default. Improvements include handling scale of 30,000+ repositories, and only showing the number of repositories remaining to be cloned.

## Easily exclude GitHub repositories from syncing (by regexp)

The `github.exclude` setting in [GitHub external service config](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/external_service/github#configuration) has been expanded to handle regular expressions using `{"pattern": "^topsecretrepogroup/.*"}`.

Previously, only names or IDs could be specified. Now, it is easier to exclude entire groups of repositories, such as repositories containing secrets, or data projects that aren‚Äôt relevant for code browsing.

## Meet us in person at GopherCon!

Our remote-first team from around the world is coming together at GopherCon next week. We are looking forward to seeing our friends in the Go community, so make sure to find us while you‚Äôre there!
