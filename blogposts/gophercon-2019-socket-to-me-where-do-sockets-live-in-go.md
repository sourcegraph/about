description: "Have you ever used HTTP server functions surfaced by the net/http package? Or gone down a couple of network levels and used TCP and UDP Listeners? Sockets are the secret sauce underlying these networking tools in Go. While Go abstracts away sockets, there are circumstances where knowing about sockets and how to configure them is instrumental. This talk will explain the fundamentals of socket-level programming in Go, and how and where to use it."
