Today is a big milestone for Sourcegraph. We've raised $23M in Series B funding, led by David Sacks at Craft Ventures. Our existing investors at Goldcrest, Redpoint, Hanover, and Burst also participated.

We're excited to welcome David Sacks of Craft Ventures to our board of directors. David helped build some of the fastest-growing enterprise software businesses–as PayPal COO, Yammer CEO, and Zenefits interim CEO. As Sourcegraph grows, we're thrilled to have help from David and the rest of our board (Dan Friedland and Adam Ross at Goldcrest, and Scott Raney at Redpoint).


Code search is most valuable when it's universal–every programming language, every file format, every code host, every developer tool, everything. This funding will let us ship [Universal Code Search](https://about.sourcegraph.com/universal-code-search) to more and more developers and cover every major language and integration by [growing our all-remote team](https://about.sourcegraph.com/jobs/). Sourcegraph Universal Code Search lets developers focus on solving problems, not struggle to find code while managing rapidly changing and complex codebases.  And it's super easy to [set up a self-hosted Sourcegraph instance for your organization's code](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/#quickstart).
