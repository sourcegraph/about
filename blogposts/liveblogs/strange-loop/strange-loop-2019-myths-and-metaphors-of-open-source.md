title: "Strange Loop 2019 - Myths and Metaphors of Open Source"
description: "Open Source Software (OSS) is built on a rich history of myths and metaphors. This talk will examine these myths and metaphors, and how physical metaphors can lead us astray in a digital world. It will also explain why Open Source Software is not a vending machine, and how OSS development and distribution platforms can impact the value people place on open source software. Clojurists Together is an organisation created to help support and grow critical open source Clojure software. This talk will discuss our experience growing Clojurists Together and some insights it has given us."

## Overview

Open Source Software (OSS) is built on a rich history of myths and metaphors. This talk will examine these myths and metaphors, and how physical metaphors can lead us astray in a digital world. It will also explain why Open Source Software is not a vending machine, and how OSS development and distribution platforms can impact the value people place on open source software. Clojurists Together is an organisation created to help support and grow critical open source Clojure software. This talk will discuss our experience growing Clojurists Together and some insights it has given us.

AWESOME LIVEBLOG CONTENT HERE!

<!-- Note on images
  Images (e.g. my_image.jpg) should be put in the `website/static/blog/strange-loop-2019` directory, with the path to the image in your post being `/blog/strange-loop-2019/my_image.jpg`. If you'd rather host the images somewhere else for ease of use, that's fine too.

  Please also try to keep your images to a reasonable size by:
    - Using JPEG compression, unless image is mostly solid color 
    - JPEG compression set between 60%-80%
    - Resizing the image to be no wider then 750px
    - If PNG, use a tool like ImageOptim (https://imageoptim.com/mac) to optimize the file size

  I suggest re-sizing and compressing all the images in one batch as a last step.
