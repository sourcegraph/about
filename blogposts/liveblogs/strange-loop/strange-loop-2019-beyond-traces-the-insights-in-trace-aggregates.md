title: "Strange Loop 2019 - Beyond traces: the insights in trace aggregates"
description: "The value proposition for distributed tracing is well-understood: assembling and visualizing end-to-end transactions helps to identify latency bottlenecks and provides a head-start on problem diagnosis. However, traditional tracing practices enable data presentation at the granularity of only a single transaction. This data is useful for debugging specific issues, but it is difficult to draw conclusions about the overall system without knowing how representative a lone trace is. Instead, aggregating these traces can reveal much more, and can do so with greater precision and certainty."

## Overview

The value proposition for distributed tracing is well-understood: assembling and visualizing end-to-end transactions helps to identify latency bottlenecks and provides a head-start on problem diagnosis. However, traditional tracing practices enable data presentation at the granularity of only a single transaction. This data is useful for debugging specific issues, but it is difficult to draw conclusions about the overall system without knowing how representative a lone trace is. Instead, aggregating these traces can reveal much more, and can do so with greater precision and certainty.

AWESOME LIVEBLOG CONTENT HERE!

<!-- Note on images
  Images (e.g. my_image.jpg) should be put in the `website/static/blog/strange-loop-2019` directory, with the path to the image in your post being `/blog/strange-loop-2019/my_image.jpg`. If you'd rather host the images somewhere else for ease of use, that's fine too.

  Please also try to keep your images to a reasonable size by:
    - Using JPEG compression, unless image is mostly solid color 
    - JPEG compression set between 60%-80%
    - Resizing the image to be no wider then 750px
    - If PNG, use a tool like ImageOptim (https://imageoptim.com/mac) to optimize the file size

  I suggest re-sizing and compressing all the images in one batch as a last step.
