description: "Recent years have seen an explosion of gradual type systems and superset languages that add types to previously untyped languages: TypeScript & Flow for Javascript, MyPy and Pyre for Python, Hack and PHP7 for PHP, Sorbet for Ruby, and many more. Implementing these type systems involves making tradeoffs between soundness (catching as many errors as possible) and completeness (not rejecting valid programs) that fundamentally impact the usability and usefulness of the type system."

## Overview

Recent years have seen an explosion of gradual type systems and superset languages that add types to previously untyped languages: TypeScript & Flow for Javascript, MyPy and Pyre for Python, Hack and PHP7 for PHP, Sorbet for Ruby, and many more. Implementing these type systems involves making tradeoffs between soundness (catching as many errors as possible) and completeness (not rejecting valid programs) that fundamentally impact the usability and usefulness of the type system.

AWESOME LIVEBLOG CONTENT HERE!

<!-- Note on images
  Images (e.g. my_image.jpg) should be put in the `website/static/blog/strange-loop-2019` directory, with the path to the image in your post being `/blog/strange-loop-2019/my_image.jpg`. If you'd rather host the images somewhere else for ease of use, that's fine too.

  Please also try to keep your images to a reasonable size by:
    - Using JPEG compression, unless image is mostly solid color 
    - JPEG compression set between 60%-80%
    - Resizing the image to be no wider then 750px
    - If PNG, use a tool like ImageOptim (https://imageoptim.com/mac) to optimize the file size

  I suggest re-sizing and compressing all the images in one batch as a last step.
