title: "Strange Loop 2019 - Automating Operations of a Global CDN"
description: "Aspects of the Netflix growth story are very visible - the transition from physical media delivery to digital streaming, or from a domestic focus to a global one. However, there are some transitions that may be less noticeable. Through this talk, you will receive insight into how we have streamlined our automation story. How we actively transitioned from large monoliths to a more decomposed, scalable set of microservices we refer to as the Open Connect Administration Platform. You will be walked through our automation journey - our history, our future, the pitfalls we have encountered and the lessons we have learned along the way."

## Overview

Aspects of the Netflix growth story are very visible - the transition from physical media delivery to digital streaming, or from a domestic focus to a global one. However, there are some transitions that may be less noticeable. Through this talk, you will receive insight into how we have streamlined our automation story. How we actively transitioned from large monoliths to a more decomposed, scalable set of microservices we refer to as the Open Connect Administration Platform. You will be walked through our automation journey - our history, our future, the pitfalls we have encountered and the lessons we have learned along the way.

AWESOME LIVEBLOG CONTENT HERE!

<!-- Note on images
  Images (e.g. my_image.jpg) should be put in the `website/static/blog/strange-loop-2019` directory, with the path to the image in your post being `/blog/strange-loop-2019/my_image.jpg`. If you'd rather host the images somewhere else for ease of use, that's fine too.

  Please also try to keep your images to a reasonable size by:
    - Using JPEG compression, unless image is mostly solid color 
    - JPEG compression set between 60%-80%
    - Resizing the image to be no wider then 750px
    - If PNG, use a tool like ImageOptim (https://imageoptim.com/mac) to optimize the file size

  I suggest re-sizing and compressing all the images in one batch as a last step.
