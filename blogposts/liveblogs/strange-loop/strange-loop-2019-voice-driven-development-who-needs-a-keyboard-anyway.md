title: "Strange Loop 2019 - Voice Driven Development: Who needs a keyboard anyway?"
description: "As a programmer, being unable to use a keyboard can seem like a career-ending limitation. I was facing that reality a year ago due to Repetitive Strain Injury, when every productive day was a step back for my health. In a futile, last-ditch effort at saving my career, I turned to speech recognition. Unexpectedly, not only was I able to return to pain-free productivity, but I found voice-driven development to be enjoyable, efficient, and a source of renewed excitement for programming. Speech recognition isn't exactly known in software development circles as a workable approach to programming, but it's better than you (probably) think! Far from imposing a tedious workflow with a specialized set of commands, speech can enable flexibility and optimizations that are difficult to achieve with a keyboard, and does not get in the way when adapting to new technologies, tools, or languages. This practical, demo-driven talk presents the approach and tools that have allowed me to continue on with my career. I'll present real world experience with speech-related topics like disambiguating homophones on the fly and teaching the voice engine new technical vocabulary. Beyond technical aspects, I will share my experience guiding a team to support this working style, and challenges to adding a microphone into an open office environment. Speech not only removes the compromise between health and career when an injury is present, but can also augment and improve the workflow for a wider audience."

## Overview

As a programmer, being unable to use a keyboard can seem like a career-ending limitation. I was facing that reality a year ago due to Repetitive Strain Injury, when every productive day was a step back for my health. In a futile, last-ditch effort at saving my career, I turned to speech recognition. Unexpectedly, not only was I able to return to pain-free productivity, but I found voice-driven development to be enjoyable, efficient, and a source of renewed excitement for programming. Speech recognition isn't exactly known in software development circles as a workable approach to programming, but it's better than you (probably) think! Far from imposing a tedious workflow with a specialized set of commands, speech can enable flexibility and optimizations that are difficult to achieve with a keyboard, and does not get in the way when adapting to new technologies, tools, or languages. This practical, demo-driven talk presents the approach and tools that have allowed me to continue on with my career. I'll present real world experience with speech-related topics like disambiguating homophones on the fly and teaching the voice engine new technical vocabulary. Beyond technical aspects, I will share my experience guiding a team to support this working style, and challenges to adding a microphone into an open office environment. Speech not only removes the compromise between health and career when an injury is present, but can also augment and improve the workflow for a wider audience.

AWESOME LIVEBLOG CONTENT HERE!

<!-- Note on images
  Images (e.g. my_image.jpg) should be put in the `website/static/blog/strange-loop-2019` directory, with the path to the image in your post being `/blog/strange-loop-2019/my_image.jpg`. If you'd rather host the images somewhere else for ease of use, that's fine too.

  Please also try to keep your images to a reasonable size by:
    - Using JPEG compression, unless image is mostly solid color 
    - JPEG compression set between 60%-80%
    - Resizing the image to be no wider then 750px
    - If PNG, use a tool like ImageOptim (https://imageoptim.com/mac) to optimize the file size

  I suggest re-sizing and compressing all the images in one batch as a last step.
