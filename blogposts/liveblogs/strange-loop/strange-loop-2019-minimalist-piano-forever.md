title: "Strange Loop 2019 - Minimalist Piano Forever"
description: "French composer Erik Satie was the forefather of avant-garde music, the founder of a one-man occult sect, and the inventor of entirely new genres for his hauntingly repetitive, minimalist piano works. Personally, I could listen to his \"Gnossiennes\" forever, so I created a way to do so, using digital sheet music, markov chains, and browser-based midi to create a generative, unending Gnossienne. This talk will explore the strategies, algorithms, and libraries I used to go from 19th and 20th century piano music to generative audio and on-the-fly sheet music in the browser. It features forays into topics ranging from how to make computer generated music sound more natural, to Erik Satie's very peculiar life."

## Overview

French composer Erik Satie was the forefather of avant-garde music, the founder of a one-man occult sect, and the inventor of entirely new genres for his hauntingly repetitive, minimalist piano works. Personally, I could listen to his \"Gnossiennes\" forever, so I created a way to do so, using digital sheet music, markov chains, and browser-based midi to create a generative, unending Gnossienne. This talk will explore the strategies, algorithms, and libraries I used to go from 19th and 20th century piano music to generative audio and on-the-fly sheet music in the browser. It features forays into topics ranging from how to make computer generated music sound more natural, to Erik Satie's very peculiar life.

AWESOME LIVEBLOG CONTENT HERE!

<!-- Note on images
  Images (e.g. my_image.jpg) should be put in the `website/static/blog/strange-loop-2019` directory, with the path to the image in your post being `/blog/strange-loop-2019/my_image.jpg`. If you'd rather host the images somewhere else for ease of use, that's fine too.

  Please also try to keep your images to a reasonable size by:
    - Using JPEG compression, unless image is mostly solid color 
    - JPEG compression set between 60%-80%
    - Resizing the image to be no wider then 750px
    - If PNG, use a tool like ImageOptim (https://imageoptim.com/mac) to optimize the file size

  I suggest re-sizing and compressing all the images in one batch as a last step.
