title: "Strange Loop 2019 - How We Tell Stories In Code"
description: "If you you ask the experts how to write 'good' software, they will likely emphasize precision and predictability. They may recommend great tools like functional programming, immutability, testing, and type systems - all of which aim to make software more reliable. But software must interact with the real world to be useful, and the real world always presents scenarios software does not account for. You can't write good software by trying to architect unpredictability out of your program. To write good working software, you must build systems that work well even though they are unpredictable and incomplete. Your code has to describe and solve a real world problem without accounting for all details of the problem. Good software tells a narrative, but like all narratives leaves things out. Maybe good programmers are really just good story tellers."

## Overview

If you you ask the experts how to write 'good' software, they will likely emphasize precision and predictability. They may recommend great tools like functional programming, immutability, testing, and type systems - all of which aim to make software more reliable. But software must interact with the real world to be useful, and the real world always presents scenarios software does not account for. You can't write good software by trying to architect unpredictability out of your program. To write good working software, you must build systems that work well even though they are unpredictable and incomplete. Your code has to describe and solve a real world problem without accounting for all details of the problem. Good software tells a narrative, but like all narratives leaves things out. Maybe good programmers are really just good story tellers.

AWESOME LIVEBLOG CONTENT HERE!

<!-- Note on images
  Images (e.g. my_image.jpg) should be put in the `website/static/blog/strange-loop-2019` directory, with the path to the image in your post being `/blog/strange-loop-2019/my_image.jpg`. If you'd rather host the images somewhere else for ease of use, that's fine too.

  Please also try to keep your images to a reasonable size by:
    - Using JPEG compression, unless image is mostly solid color 
    - JPEG compression set between 60%-80%
    - Resizing the image to be no wider then 750px
    - If PNG, use a tool like ImageOptim (https://imageoptim.com/mac) to optimize the file size

  I suggest re-sizing and compressing all the images in one batch as a last step.
