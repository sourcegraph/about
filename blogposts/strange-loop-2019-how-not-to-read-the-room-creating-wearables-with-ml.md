title: "Strange Loop 2019 - How not to read the room: Creating wearables with ML"
description: "I'm an introvert. This can be a bit unfortunate, when you are a person that enjoys spending a lot of free time creating fashion things bedazzled with LEDs... only to rarely wear them out in public. In an effort to actually share my weird and wonderful creations with others, I decided to create a wearable project that would force me to be sociable in order for it to reveal its magic. In this talk, I'll share how I am using machine learning with javascript and tiny computers to make \"fashion\" that is responsive to the people around you and the attention you are (or aren't) receiving."

## Overview

I'm an introvert. This can be a bit unfortunate, when you are a person that enjoys spending a lot of free time creating fashion things bedazzled with LEDs... only to rarely wear them out in public. In an effort to actually share my weird and wonderful creations with others, I decided to create a wearable project that would force me to be sociable in order for it to reveal its magic. In this talk, I'll share how I am using machine learning with javascript and tiny computers to make \"fashion\" that is responsive to the people around you and the attention you are (or aren't) receiving.

AWESOME LIVEBLOG CONTENT HERE!

<!-- Note on images
  Images (e.g. my_image.jpg) should be put in the `website/static/blog/strange-loop-2019` directory, with the path to the image in your post being `/blog/strange-loop-2019/my_image.jpg`. If you'd rather host the images somewhere else for ease of use, that's fine too.

  Please also try to keep your images to a reasonable size by:
    - Using JPEG compression, unless image is mostly solid color 
    - JPEG compression set between 60%-80%
    - Resizing the image to be no wider then 750px
    - If PNG, use a tool like ImageOptim (https://imageoptim.com/mac) to optimize the file size

  I suggest re-sizing and compressing all the images in one batch as a last step.
