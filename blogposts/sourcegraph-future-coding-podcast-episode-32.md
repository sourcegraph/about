Our CEO [@sqs (Quinn Slack)](https://twitter.com/sqs) was on the [Future of Coding podcast this week](https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/32) to talk about basic developer human rights, the [Sourcegraph master plan](https://about.sourcegraph.com/company/strategy), and the future of developer tools.

> As a developer, you have these questions you need answered: How do I do this thing in the code? Why is it built this way? Why did this thing break?

> There are a lot of developers who've never seen what a good code search tool can do for you. They might search inside their editor, but they're not benefiting from code search.

> We're really building a brand new product that most developers do not have a ton of experience with, but that really clicks for them quickly.
