We are building [the best code search and browsing tool for your team](/) to help you write, review, and ship code better. Our mission is to [bring the future sooner](/handbook/company/strategy) by bringing the best tools to developers everywhere.

Our announcement this month that [Sourcegraph is now open source](/handbook/community/faq) is one way we will get there even faster.

Here’s new, what’s changed, and what’s fixed in Sourcegraph 2.12.

- [Build and publish your own Sourcegraph extensions](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/extensions/authoring) (like the [Codecov Sourcegraph extension](https://twitter.com/sourcegraph/status/1038200208138502144))

- [Sourcegraph for GitLab](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/integration/gitlab)

- [Discussions code and docs in repositories (*deprecated 3.16*)](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/9649)

- [Product subscriptions, self-service checkout, and easy upgrades to Enterprise](/pricing)
