title: "Strange Loop 2019 - Meander: Declarative Explorations at the Limits of FP"
description: "As functional programmers we love to pay lip service to declarative data transformation. Yet this allegiance rarely plays out in our actual code. Data transforming combinators (map, filter, reduce, etc) offer significant expressive power over manual loops and mutation, but when combined in complex ways, lose their declarative power. Lost in a web of nested pipelines, the shape of our data becomes obscured; our code becomes hard to follow. We wind up, yet again, needing to play computer in our heads to understand what our code is doing."

## Overview

As functional programmers we love to pay lip service to declarative data transformation. Yet this allegiance rarely plays out in our actual code. Data transforming combinators (map, filter, reduce, etc) offer significant expressive power over manual loops and mutation, but when combined in complex ways, lose their declarative power. Lost in a web of nested pipelines, the shape of our data becomes obscured; our code becomes hard to follow. We wind up, yet again, needing to play computer in our heads to understand what our code is doing.

AWESOME LIVEBLOG CONTENT HERE!

<!-- Note on images
  Images (e.g. my_image.jpg) should be put in the `website/static/blog/strange-loop-2019` directory, with the path to the image in your post being `/blog/strange-loop-2019/my_image.jpg`. If you'd rather host the images somewhere else for ease of use, that's fine too.

  Please also try to keep your images to a reasonable size by:
    - Using JPEG compression, unless image is mostly solid color 
    - JPEG compression set between 60%-80%
    - Resizing the image to be no wider then 750px
    - If PNG, use a tool like ImageOptim (https://imageoptim.com/mac) to optimize the file size

  I suggest re-sizing and compressing all the images in one batch as a last step.
