**Update:** This blog post has been edited to remove references to outdated features.

We’ve been hard at work on some major improvements to how you search, browse, and review code. Today we’re excited to announce several big new features.

## Introducing Sourcegraph

Already used by many of our customers and now available to all companies, Sourcegraph gives you code search and intelligence across all your company’s private and public code. It integrates with multiple code hosts, editors, and code review tools to increase productivity throughout the developer workflow.

Sourcegraph is what powers <a href="https://sourcegraph.com/">Sourcegraph.com</a>, and now you can run it inside your company's network. [Install a self-hosted Sourcegraph instance in 1 command.](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/#quickstart)

## Explore open source code with the new Sourcegraph.com and browser extensions

Search and browse open source code on <a href="https://sourcegraph.com/">Sourcegraph.com</a> and using the [Sourcegraph browser extension](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/integration/browser_extension) (on GitHub), with full code intelligence: go-to-definition, find-references, etc. The full power of Sourcegraph is always free for open source.

What’s new and different:

* A single search box to search code and repositories, with regular expression and other advanced query support
* Streamlined interface for code navigation (with go-to-definition and find-references)

## Use Sourcegraph at work

We hear overwhelmingly from our users: "I love Sourcegraph on open source code, and I want to use it for work." Our new products are built to make this even easier. You can use Sourcegraph on your organization's code, and it all stays secure on your own network. Your code never touches our servers, and both products connect directly to your cloud or enterprise code hosts to work across all of your repositories.
