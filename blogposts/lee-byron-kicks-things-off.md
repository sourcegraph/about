Lee Byron kicks things off here at GraphQL Summit.

He was on the original GraphQL team, working to make mobile development better at Facebook. A little over 2 years ago, they wrote it up as an official spec and released it publicly.

Today, we're going to hear from companies big and small about how they solved problems both similar and disimilar to what they were targeting at Facebook.

But that's not why we're here today. We're here today because of the community. All the talks today are conversation starters. The conference really picks up outside the presentation hall doors.

Now, we're going to kick things off with our keynote speaker.
