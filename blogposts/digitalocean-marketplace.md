Today, DigitalOcean released their new [Marketplace](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/), a platform for partners such as [Sourcegraph](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/sourcegraph?action=deploy&refcode=48dfb3ccb51c) to provide trusted, pre-configured Droplets that install in one-click and are ready in 60 seconds or less.

What is Sourcegraph? Sourcegraph is a code search and intelligence tool for developers. It lets you search and explore all of your organizationâ€™s code on the web, with integrations into your existing tools.

One-click Sourcegraph deployment solutions such as the [DigitalOcean marketplace](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/sourcegraph?action=deploy&refcode=48dfb3ccb51c) make it possible for any developer to bring Sourcegraph's code search and intelligence to their organization, regardless of their knowledge of technologies such as Docker.

New customers can get $100 starting balance (60 day expiry) when [deploying Sourcegraph through the Marketplace](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/sourcegraph?action=deploy&refcode=48dfb3ccb51c).

We love that DigitalOcean has made it so easy to deploy Sourcegraph and we'd love your feedback via a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-digitalocean), [tweet (@srcgraph)](https://twitter.com/srcgraph) or [email](mailto:support@sourcegraph.com?subject=Sourcegraph%20DigitalOcean%20Marketplace%20Install).
