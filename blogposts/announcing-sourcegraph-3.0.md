# Announcing Sourcegraph 3.0

We're excited to announce a big update, Sourcegraph 3.0. This major release makes Sourcegraph into a platform that gives you code intelligence and other helpful integrations in code search, browsing, code hosts, review tools, and (soon) editors. It includes:

> TODO: The bullets below will link to the docs for each feature (which exist as PRs at https://github.com/sourcegraph/about/pulls).

- The ability to create and use Sourcegraph extensions, which are like editor extensions but run in all of your dev tools.
- All code intelligence (hovers, definitions, references, etc.) is provided via Sourcegraph extensions, which means increased coverage, more language-specific features, and greater configurability.
- Search supports language-specific query keywords, such as `js.depends:` and `go.imports:` for finding where a package is used.
- Repository permissions on your code host (starting with GitLab) are now respected, so users can only search/view code in authorized repositories.
- Faster search on the single-node deployment option (`sourcegraph/server` Docker image) when indexed search is enabled.
- Deploying and managing a Sourcegraph cluster for high-scale and high-availability is easier, with fewer services to run and online configuration updating.

This 3.0 release is recommended for all new Sourcegraph instance. If you're currently running Sourcegraph 2.x, contact us for customized advice on how to upgrade to 3.0.
