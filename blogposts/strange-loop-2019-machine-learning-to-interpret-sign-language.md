## Overview

Instead of just teaching Deaf people how to get along with the rest of the world and understand them, why don't we make an effort to understand them and their language via technology?! In this talk we will learn how to use machine learning to interpret sign language.

AWESOME LIVEBLOG CONTENT HERE!

<!-- Note on images
  Images (e.g. my_image.jpg) should be put in the `website/static/blog/strange-loop-2019` directory, with the path to the image in your post being `/blog/strange-loop-2019/my_image.jpg`. If you'd rather host the images somewhere else for ease of use, that's fine too.

  Please also try to keep your images to a reasonable size by:
    - Using JPEG compression, unless image is mostly solid color 
    - JPEG compression set between 60%-80%
    - Resizing the image to be no wider then 750px
    - If PNG, use a tool like ImageOptim (https://imageoptim.com/mac) to optimize the file size

  I suggest re-sizing and compressing all the images in one batch as a last step.
