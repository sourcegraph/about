description: "Although LinkedIn data continues to grow rapidly over the years, scaling up to handle the increasing data volume has not been the only challenge in streaming data in near real-time. Supporting the proliferation of new data systems has become yet another huge endeavor for data streaming infrastructure at LinkedIn. Building separate, specialized solutions to move data across heterogeneous systems is not sustainable, as it slows down development and makes the infrastructure unmanageable. This called for a centralized, managed, and extensible solution that can continuously deliver data to nearline applications."

## Overview

Although LinkedIn data continues to grow rapidly over the years, scaling up to handle the increasing data volume has not been the only challenge in streaming data in near real-time. Supporting the proliferation of new data systems has become yet another huge endeavor for data streaming infrastructure at LinkedIn. Building separate, specialized solutions to move data across heterogeneous systems is not sustainable, as it slows down development and makes the infrastructure unmanageable. This called for a centralized, managed, and extensible solution that can continuously deliver data to nearline applications.

AWESOME LIVEBLOG CONTENT HERE!

<!-- Note on images
  Images (e.g. my_image.jpg) should be put in the `website/static/blog/strange-loop-2019` directory, with the path to the image in your post being `/blog/strange-loop-2019/my_image.jpg`. If you'd rather host the images somewhere else for ease of use, that's fine too.

  Please also try to keep your images to a reasonable size by:
    - Using JPEG compression, unless image is mostly solid color 
    - JPEG compression set between 60%-80%
    - Resizing the image to be no wider then 750px
    - If PNG, use a tool like ImageOptim (https://imageoptim.com/mac) to optimize the file size

  I suggest re-sizing and compressing all the images in one batch as a last step.
