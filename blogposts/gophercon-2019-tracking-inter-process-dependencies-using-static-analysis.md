title: "GopherCon 2019 - Tracking inter-process dependencies using static analysis"
description: "Using a service-oriented architecture instead of a monolithic architecture adds flexibility but also increases complexity. How will we keep track of which parts of our system depend on each other? To help solve this problem, I've been working on a project to analyze Go code (using Go!) to detect inter-process dependencies in our system. In this talk, I'll give a brief introduction to the static analysis libraries I used and share a few tips about how to use them effectively. I'll discuss obstacles I encountered along the way and my attempts to overcome them."

## Overview

Using a service-oriented architecture instead of a monolithic architecture adds flexibility but also increases complexity. How will we keep track of which parts of our system depend on each other? To help solve this problem, I've been working on a project to analyze Go code (using Go!) to detect inter-process dependencies in our system. In this talk, I'll give a brief introduction to the static analysis libraries I used and share a few tips about how to use them effectively. I'll discuss obstacles I encountered along the way and my attempts to overcome them.
