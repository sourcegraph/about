# Careers

Join us on our mission to make it so everyone, in every community, in every country, and in every industry can create products using the best technology. Read [Sourcegraph strategy](strategy.md) to learn more about what we're building, and why it matters.

## Open positions

We're hiring! All our positions are remote. Our teammates are distributed [around the world.](https://about.sourcegraph.com/company/team)

## Internships and new grad hiring

Generally, we are not hiring for interns and new grads. The decision to hire interns and new grads are determined by individual hiring managers. People considered for intern and new grad roles have demonstrated skills and project work above their peer group. Examples of this work are building an open source project related to Sourcegraph, acting as a primary maintainer for a significant open source dependency, significant contribution to open source projects, or something of that caliber.
