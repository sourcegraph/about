## 1-1s

This is how I run [1-1s](../../handbook/leadership/1-1.md) with my direct reports.

- 1-1s are 25 minutes weekly.
- 1-1s start 5 minutes after the hour or half hour (e.g. 9:05, 9:35).
- Add topics that you want to discuss to our [shared 1-1 notes Google Doc](../../handbook/leadership/1-1.md#google-doc).
- 1-1 agenda:
  - Say hello and chit-chat about personal lives (~5 minutes).
  - Talk about agenda items.
  - We will end on time, even if we haven't covered all agenda items, and even if neither of us have a meeting immediately after.
    - If an agenda item hasn't been discussed, it is the responsibility of the person who added that agenda item to decide what to do with it (e.g. start a Slack conversation, schedule another meeting, discuss in the next 1-1, take no action because it wasn't important).

The first three 1-1s I have with a direct report are a little different because I want to spend time getting to know you.

1. Tell me about your life starting from grade school.
2. What do you want to do at the pinnacle of your career?
3. I will reflect back things I heard and tell you about how I think I can help you achieve your goals and be successful at Sourcegraph.

## Skip level 1-1s

A skip level 1-1 is between me and someone who I indirectly manage (e.g. the person reports to a person that I manage).

If you would like to have a skip level 1-1 with me:

1. Find a time on my calendar that is open and send me a calendar invite.
2. Include as much context as is relevant so that I can prepare for the 1-1 if necessary.
