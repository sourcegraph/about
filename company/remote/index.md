# All-remote

Sourcegraph is an all-remote company, which means:

- All teammates work remotely.
- Sourcegraph does not have any offices, except for a small office in San Francisco used to provide a mailing address, for corporate filings, and as legally required.
- We work asynchronously across time zones and continents.
  - Teammates are responsible for setting their own work hours and marking them in Google Calendar.
  - We try to limit the number of synchronous meetings, but there are some [company](../../handbook/communication/company_meeting.md) and team meetings that you need to attend which might be outside of your normal working hours. We do our best to optimize meeting times for all involved participants.
