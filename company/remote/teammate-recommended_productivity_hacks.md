# Teammate-recommended productivity hacks

Because Sourcegraph is all-remote, we actively share tips + tricks for using all our digital tools effectively. Take what works for you and ignore what doesn't, and please do add your own. 

You might think of this page as a remote version of "the clever workflows and shortcuts you'd notice by looking over someone's shoulder as they worked."

## Slack 

- **Set up [custom channel sections](https://slack.com/help/articles/360043207674-Organize-your-sidebar-with-custom-sections) in your sidebar to organize all your channels.** You can expand/collapse groups of channels. For example, you might make a group called "Social" that contains channels like #random, #pets-of-sourcegraph, and #cooking.
- **Automatically add links to your slack posts by copying a url, highlighting the text you want to link in the slack message, and then pasting.** This way you can use `cmd`+`v` instead of the Slack "add link" button or the slack keyboard shortcut of `cmd`+`shift`+`U`.

### Popular app integrations 
- **[Connect your Google calendar](https://slack.com/app-pages/google-calendar)** to get reminders and show when you're in a meeting. 
- **[Connect Zoom](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/apps/A5GE9BMQC-zoom)** so you can type `/zoom` and quickly start zoom calls. 

## Web Browsers

### Chrome 

- **Create lots of custom search shortcuts**: You can create these for any website, and we recommend setting up the [handbook search shortcut](../../handbook/usage/index.md#setup) and the [Sourcegraph.com search shortcut](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/integration/browser_search_engine#google-chrome). Other popular search shortcuts are Google Drive, GitHub issues search, or Salesforce. 
- **Use a tab manager** like [Tabbs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabbs/cicnbbdlbjaoioilpbdioeeaockgbhfi) or [Tabli](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabli/igeehkedfibbnhbfponhjjplpkeomghi). 
- **Set up a separate [Chrome profile](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en)** so you can keep your work and personal bookmarks and autocompletes/shortcuts separate. 

## Other tools 

- [Loom](https://loom.com) for quick videos for demos or bugs.

## Miscellaneous 

- **Learn the keyboard shortcut to pull up your emoji keyboard:** now you can emoji-react places beyond Slack, or use emojis for visual distinction in titles/comments in all your other tools. On Mac it's `command`+`control`+`space`.
