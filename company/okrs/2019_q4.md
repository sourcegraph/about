# 2019-Q4 OKRs

1. CEO: Net new ARR
   1. Sales (Closing Deals): Reach [$N](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1clukaACTCjPLnmhEttJXcOwadxHEGYK24Znn0HUQGB0/edit#bookmark=kix.n8t17z6iyawc) net new ARR in Q4 by fully onboarding 2 new AEs who will close 4 Tier 1 deals (>=$100K ARR) and 11 non-Tier 1 deals. Get 70% of companies on a free trial to convert to paid customers.
   1. Sales (Deal Optimization): Scale our sales pipeline to 50+ deals per AE, of which 60% of deals are engaged and actively evaluating Sourcegraph. Maintain company-wide HubSpot consistency to generate actionable reporting from data logged.
   1. Business (Marketing): Build the lead generation engine that will support 4-5x ARR growth in 2020. Begin tracking and measuring each stage of the funnel and conversion across them, grow MQLs delivered to sales weekly by 3x, hire two additional full-time marketing or DevRel teammates (including one Online Marketer).
   1. Business (Customer Success): Build a Customer Success playbook that will achieve 16% net negative dollar retention in 2019-Q4 ([note](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1clukaACTCjPLnmhEttJXcOwadxHEGYK24Znn0HUQGB0/edit#bookmark=id.555yhh8djvze)) and to put us on a path to continue to achieve net negative dollar retention through 2020. Test a set of new success efforts (e.g., live brown bag lunches, monthly webinars, increased communication of value delivered) to determine highest ROI efforts, start these efforts with all Tier 1 customers, hire or assign an owner to ensure they continue to happen.
   1. Product: Increase engagement with the product.
