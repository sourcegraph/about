# 2019-Q4 OKRs

1. CEO: Net new ARR
   1. Sales (Closing Deals): Reach [$N](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1clukaACTCjPLnmhEttJXcOwadxHEGYK24Znn0HUQGB0/edit#bookmark=kix.n8t17z6iyawc) net new ARR in Q4 by fully onboarding 2 new AEs who will close 4 Tier 1 deals (>=$100K ARR) and 11 non-Tier 1 deals. Get 70% of companies on a free trial to convert to paid customers.
   1. Sales (Deal Optimization): Scale our sales pipeline to 50+ deals per AE, of which 60% of deals are engaged and actively evaluating Sourcegraph. Maintain company-wide HubSpot consistency to generate actionable reporting from data logged.
   1. Business (Marketing): Build the lead generation engine that will support 4-5x ARR growth in 2020. Begin tracking and measuring each stage of the funnel and conversion across them, grow MQLs delivered to sales weekly by 3x, hire two additional full-time marketing or DevRel teammates (including one Online Marketer).
   1. Business (Customer Success): Build a Customer Success playbook that will achieve 16% net negative dollar retention in 2019-Q4 ([note](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1clukaACTCjPLnmhEttJXcOwadxHEGYK24Znn0HUQGB0/edit#bookmark=id.555yhh8djvze)) and to put us on a path to continue to achieve net negative dollar retention through 2020. Test a set of new success efforts (e.g., live brown bag lunches, monthly webinars, increased communication of value delivered) to determine highest ROI efforts, start these efforts with all Tier 1 customers, hire or assign an owner to ensure they continue to happen.
   1. Product: Increase engagement with the product. Increase SWAUs by 25%, identify the top 3 reasons potential customers do not sign, open source projects in GitLab use Sourcegraph.com for on-by-default code intelligence (without the browser extension).
   1. VP Eng: Sourcegraph has world class reliability. 100% of monthly releases ship on time, no tier 1 or 2 customers are blocked from upgrading to a monthly release once it ships.
      1. Distribution: Automate time-consuming ops and support tasks. Major/minor and patch releases take 1 hour (including general QA but excluding customer-specific testing), all customer specific testing is complete within 2 business days of tagging any release.
      1. Distribution: Streamline technical blockers for tier-1 customers advancing toward general availability. Address all rollout-blocking issues within 1 iteration of reporting, scale search and authz to [C1](https://app.hubspot.com/contacts/2762526/company/407948923/) and [C2](https://app.hubspot.com/contacts/2762526/company/1712889883/) requirements by EOY.

      1. Web: Data driven decisions for search improvements. Measure number/type of filters used for each search on customer instances, measure the number of searches that result in an error.
      1. Core services: Sourcegraph search scales to our largest customers. Symbol and text search returns in under 2s on instances with 80k repositories and configured ACLs for 1k active users, Sourcegraph can index any code independent of code host and version control system, admins know what percentage of repositories are available for search and when the instance will reach 100% availability.
