<!-- START SUMMARY -->

How do Google developers create and spread internal tools? In this episode, Han-Wen Nienhuys, creator of the open-source code search engine Zoekt, joins Beyang Liu, co-founder and CTO of Sourcegraph, to discuss the agonizing experience with Perforce that drove Hen-Wen to build his first dev tool, to explain value of coding on trains and planes, and tell the story of how building code search nearly inspired a street named after him in Sweden. Along the way, Han-Wen offers an inside look at the history behind some of Googleâ€™s most famous dev tools, such as Blaze, Code Search, and Piper.
