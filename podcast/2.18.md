<!-- START SUMMARY -->

Why is the software industry now willing and excited to buy developer tools instead of building them internally? In this episode, Kelly Norton, principal software engineer at Mailchimp and creator of open-source code search engine Hound, joins Beyang Liu, co-founder and CTO of Sourcegraph, to talk about his work on the controversial project that would become Google Web Toolkit, share his experience trying to build an ecosystem of tooling, which resulted in Google Dart, and explain how the company he founded, FullStory, pioneered user testing. Along the way, Kelly describes how and why he developed Hound at Etsy, and shares his thoughts on the developer tools market.
