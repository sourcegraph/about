<!-- START SUMMARY -->
[Syrus Akbary](https://twitter.com/syrusakbary) is the founder and CEO of [Wasmer](https://wasmer.io/), the startup behind the [open-source web assembly runtime](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer) that's doing for WebAssembly what Docker did for LXC. Syrus explains what WebAssembly is, why it matters outside your browser, and how it compares to other virtualization technologies. He shares the pains that motivated him to look into WebAssembly and eventually led him to create a new WebAssembly runtime and a new company around it. We dive deep into WebAssembly as a technology, its portability and performance characteristics, and talk about the importance of prioritizing community and developer experience when building new development platforms.

**Beyang:** All right I'm here with founder and CEO of Wasmer, an opensource WebAssembly runtime and startup that lets you run WebAssembly compiled code outside the browser. Syrus, welcome.

**Syrus:** Thank you very much, Beyang. I'm super happy to be here today.

**Beyang:** Awesome So we have a lot of ground to cover today and there's so much I want to get to uh with respect to Wasmer and also WebAssembly in general. But before we get into that I would like to kick things off by asking people you know how did they get into programming Uh originally 

**Syrus:** Well some so we make  peculiar because I actually liked created a website when I was 14 years old That was for watching TV Sunday sending radios online.  At the beginning of actually like I just had it I have a personal website and I edited a new section for watching TV and radio online Um and then this this section got like super popular So I created a special website for that All these was pre YouTube like in 2006 or 2005 Um so I created this new website got super super popular in Spain actually Like we got like 300 K visitors per month Um I remember I yeah I remember I put like Google uh Google ads on their website and I was earning more money than my parents like when I was like 14 or 15 years old So that was an interesting experience 

**Beyang:** That's awesome And uh I take it from there You were just at the forefront of all the things that were happening uh on the web And uh I guess that's how you stumbled into the uh the WebAssembly world 

**Syrus:** Well it's uh you see what's a little bit longer Some actually I started doing doing front end work a front end or backend actually at the beginning when I created the website for me there was no difference between back and up front then everything was It was kind of web Um so uh so I did uh I did this the accessory lab I went into a startup in Spain Then I jumped into Silicon Valley And then from there basically like fast forward I created an open source framework That'd become popular There was in Python for using Greenfield And then from there I expanded into into their web assembly world 

**Beyang:** Got it Awesome And and can you explain for people who might be a little bit unfamiliar with this world Um what is what is WebAssembly and why does it matter 

**Syrus:** So what was somebody it's a technology that was invented by the browser vendors In order to be able to execute code at super super fastest speeds in the browser but also in a way that was well safe Basically Like when you access a website do you want to make sure these website doesn't have access to things that it should not have access to Right Like you have like more a sandbox environment rather than native programs So that's kind of like what it got into integrating web assembling 

**Beyang:** Got it And uh unlike what came before it you don't have to write your code in JavaScript right You can uh in theory write your code in any programming language as long as it compiles down in a WebAssembly

**Syrus:** Yes So the history of uh of uh because everything is started with ASM dot JS which it was created by Alan Alan Sekai and the UMBC like what he did was a LBM bit code converted from basically like LBM bit code into JavaScript Um it was kind of like simple because it had like super basic instructions So Kate created that subset of data script that like could be typed and could be basically like interpreted by the JavaScript VMs in a much faster way than normal JavaScript So he with that like you were able to to basically like run almost any problem that could be compiled with LOVM So that means like C or C plus plus programs at the beginning Which which that visitor ID was a great proof of concept And you started getting like games like uh I'm not sure if it was do more quake or something like that just running on the browser like super flashy But then at the same time Google was trying to Bush or other uh other uh technology call native client um native client client was a was kind of like a similar approach Do they have to the same problem which was how we can make Run any kind of Purim at that at a much faster way in a sandbox in a sandbox a way So so they created the knuckle uh some way to approach that but it was like super proprietary That means kind of like they didn't go the agreement from other vendors and the approach from a from ASM here's the advantage that they have against like knuckle knuckle is electronic for for native client Um The advantage that the ASM has had was like it basically could work even in browsers that didn't support um that didn't explain basically support a knuckle and the main reason for all this it was because it was just a subset of the demo script So that means it could run ASM dot JS could run on on interim expert or infer folks 

**Beyang:** Yeah that makes sense And in both ASM dot JS and NACAL were both kind of motivated by people just trying to get away from JavaScript or like writing code and other languages that would be more performant than they could ever make a JavaScript runtime Is that right 

**Syrus:** Yes I will say like performance was a big part of of that visit Like it was not easy to run a code that uh at a super speeds with street I mean JavaScript BMS are great but like the fiber you have to run code in 'em In a basically like to fulfill the standards of JavaScript just it will means that it always will have some overhead So in general like even with the best case scenario demonstrate blue to be like two or three times slower than than native code 

**Beyang:** Would you say WebAssembly took more inspiration from the ASM dot JS world or from the natural world Or was it is it kind of a pretty balanced synthesis of those two predecessors 

**Syrus:** I think it was from from both honestly I think they just like basically the people from the Firefox team because uh was recruited by by Firefox at the beginning he was working on ASM dot JS I think also as part of the Mattila Mazzola and I think they just like got all together saying like okay like not Cole like we is not like good enough because knuckle under the hood was sexually I think using the LBM bit code So in that goal was it like not kind of like portable enough um ASM the gas was like still JavaScript So um it's it's kinda like you have to do like a special tricks to optimize it I think they just like went all together and undecided to to create something that like basically all the browsers could could understand I'm actually finally and they created that web assembly to JavaScript a converter So basically like it will It's still work with all browsers even on the ones that they don't directly support What was humbling 

**Beyang:** Got it That's cool So I guess fast forward to today um most I think almost every major browser uh has a WebAssembly uh environment Uh and you also have which is this WebAssembly environment that runs outside of the browser Um can you tell us a little bit about asthma and what what's kind of the you know the quick elevator pitch for why people should care about it 

**Syrus:** So just first to understand what we what we won was more I think it's good to do a very simple analogy which is If you remember like what no JS did like bringing uh script to the server side we are doing like something similar taking the well technology that was created on the browsers Um we are moving it server side and they and the main question is why you are doing that actually like why people would want to actually get well somebody's server side And the main reason for that is that you have with mobile somebody you have like a universal binary format that Almost any like tips or platforms could understand So that means it's fully portable but at the same time is super sandboxed So um so the fact that this is a sandbox and um um And also is it's super fast I mean it's universal It makes it actually ideal just to run over in general So that's kind of like one of their realizations that I had Yeah And um I'm basically like why I started the Wasmer was because when I tried to use wall somebody's server side I realized that it was actually like very very hard and the ecosystem was to run what was somebody's server side So um us uh someone with that very uh hardcore developer mindset I thought that's what I like We could improve that experience and make it much easier for developers and for companies to SRL thing What was the server side to run silver 

**Beyang:** Cool What languages are are um compiled down into WebAssembly at the moment 

**Syrus:** So at the moment there is C and C plus plus of course um we have rust as well Um apart of rust we have go we have um other languages that docs also like could compile down to um to uh WebAssembly in general any language that under the hood basically like is compiled and he's using LLVM under the food Could we compile into what we're assembling Um but then there are other um other projects that are actually um making possible to for example like convert a Java byte code or like basically like  There is a real incentive for languages to be able to target the browser Why Because it expands their market So that means like almost any other language right now is trying to compile down to wherever somebody because it just kind of like a sponsor market and make sure that the language Prosper on their on their own term So uh we have like on one side we have uh Devaa bytecode that could be five 12 Somebody with TBM we have also like Python interpreter because playfulness is stealing like interpreter So you have to compile the interpreter itself to well assembling and then you can run it which is actually already already possible Um I would say almost any other language from an animal that you can imagine it could be compiled on 12 assembly either in that full compile form or in the interpreted way 

**Beyang:** So kind of the the web assembly dream is this kind of Holy grail that people have been after for a while now which is you know I can write code in any language and I should be able to run it anywhere whether that's you know in the browser or on the server or on my desktop machine running like any operating system like the dream is like write it in any language and then run it uh everywhere Is that is that right 

**Syrus:** Yes That's kind of like yeah That's the ideal scenario Like I think We have been working a lot on on um being trying to run silver in different platforms We realized that quite hard We realize that this quite hard to integrate programs that are made in rust read them in our Python programs or problems that they're made in See how we can integrate it into or demo script programs Or for example we create a program that will work in our in our Mac machine but this same binary will not work in windows or this same binary Will not work in Linux So we assume a lot of like issues that we have when running solver that should not happen And what was somebody they say remove all these barriers Um um what that allows us is to just make sure that one binary could actually be Be executed in any platform or basically in any ecosystem very easily So if you realize it it's actually quite close to what they the promise of the of Java of the Java we have so much w would be with the main difference that that's what I get I will say the bytecode format is a is is much better designed Because they have a lot of lessons learned And also you have like industry um like basically all the industry wants to push for that and it's open The specification is not preparatory So I think this is actually what is pushing what was somebody even farther 

**Beyang:** cool And you know I kind of want to rewind a bit uh to earlier when you're talking about um your motivations for creating Wiseburn So you mentioned that you you created Wiseman out of um kind of these pain points that you experienced uh working on your previous startup uh graphene And can can you talk about you know what the WebAssembly ecosystem was like back then and what was the kind of gap that you saw that is trying to fill 

**Syrus:** Yes some so some background uh around uh four or five years ago I created this this graphical framework for using Rockwell in Python called Ruffin And um and this spring where become like super super popular And when I created the company about I was Griffin I was actually uh Kind of competing against other startups that have funding We're actually Ruffin We didn't raise any money I had no idea how to raise money Those being like a nice learning but like yeah I have no idea how to raise money so we didn't have money on the bank And I was trying to see how I can expand the Phoenix ecosystem And I realized that if we actually target what was humbling we could get a Griffin actually used in a lot of different languages Why is that uh the gruff spaces very special and this is special because there is a reference implementation which is made in JavaScript and all the other implementations that you see in Python in Ruby in rust basically like in go they are all porting by hand the demo script reference implementation to the different languages and these and I don't these and it's been like super time consuming And I realized like why we need to do that why I have a parameter and they need to translate it from JavaScript into byte Like this is suboptimal So ideally what uh what I realized we could have is okay so that like one universal engine that could run it could run everywhere could run in Python could run and go could run in rust currently Java And that means kind of like you don't need to Recreate a lot of the integration uh issues or the integration things with a 13 prime language that you have basically you can assure that will be given by the by the university library So that's kinda like what it pushed me to uh start researching uh late into um into the WebAssembly world

And um yeah like that's kinda like what got me into into what was humbling but then the more I dig into web assembling the more I realize that it could be useful not only for um for using uh universal libraries that could be could be used in a lot of different programming languages at the same time but also for cloud computing and edge computing and IOT

**Beyang:** Got it And were there uh existing uh runtimes back then that ran outside the browser was Westmore the first 

**Syrus:** No there were others There was a wobble Juan was one of the first uh what was some little machines that what that existed And actually I collaborated a lot into before it's starting I mean when I say a lot this there's like three or four per request So not really that much more Um it was amazing meeting seam and I'm not super familiar with it but actually I did it was not easy for me to collaborate into although actually the maintainer was was great He was awesome Um but I realized Robin was uh was sort of like Taking a lot of time to compile an idea like that And they may I are collaborating to other runtime called Watson which right now is doesn't exist Um this one was actually like Creating by hand all the assembly code that was where it was corresponding to to a certain what was some liberation Um I realized that was spot that path What's actually very suboptimal It was very very very hard to maintain So with these two approaches I realized that there was um basically like the system solutions that were standalone were not easy to run What was on the server side were not ideal for for me as a developer to to use it And then I started sneaking into the VMs that uh that the browsers use right Because all the browsers have like a warp assembly VM that is tightly integrated into their devastated VM So that was that was great That was very insightful But I realize that Running above somebody's VM on within their service without Dallas grip was actually like quite quite challenging So um that's that's when I realized that actually we need that engine that like it's the couple from the JavaScript engine Um again like browsers do optimizations that are in general uh useful to remove the boundaries between JavaScript and um or to decrease the the um Degrees of performance when you cross the boundaries between JavaScript and what of assembly Um but in the case of the reasonable we've actually the chemistry those that you want to make our Allianz it'll be different So that's why why that's when I decided that we needed a proper round time to rumble over somebody's server side 

**Beyang:** Got it So you you kind of tried uh some of the existing uh WebAssembly runtimes on the service side you had uh various difficulties some difficulty collaborating uh in existing code bases You checked out the browser Uh in browser run times and it was hard to just rip those out So that kind of motivated the formation of of last summer 

**Syrus:** Yeah I'm not the same time It was funny because at the same time I saw like an article from CloudFare where they were basically like talking about that cluster of workers and isolates and they were mentioning how Foster the startup times uh basically like how fast compared to like Nomar containers And at that moment basically my man did click on it He was like okay this is going to be big just for running silver in general And the ecosystem is still very early So there is a big opportunity to actually like provide something to um to help developers and to help companies to the world of somebody's server site 

**Beyang:** yeah that makes sense Yeah I've heard I've heard a lot about CloudFlare investing in WebAssembly as kind of a runtime to run like serverless uh workloads Um is that uh are they building their own runtime or are they using or um how are they going about doing that 

**Syrus:** In the case of Glossier they are using because actually like their club Fleur workers offering is highly tied to JavaScript Some you can execute JavaScript on their VM So for that reason they are actually using using the aid There are some some issues when when running actually a what was somebody on B eight which is When when you want to speed up completion time and when you want to cash it And so on they say like this the serialization time uh which is operation that you do to skip compilation and just basically like getting it from cash um that the sterilization time is is much lower than uh than if you actually have like native images Um so in general like like trade offs that are I will say not as good for running bubble somebody's server side although it's actually like it's super great What were some of your run time 

**Beyang:** Got it And are other uh like cloud computing companies also investing in this or is this kind of like CloudFlare though The only 

**Syrus:** So cloud for I'm not sure if it was the first one or um or uh on the CB and the space or if it was fascinating So Fastly also has been down like researching on the on the WebAssembly on the server side wall for for some for some years Um Mmm Um they actually like open source lucid about like which is what was somebody's runtime Uh they open source sites about like four months or five months after we opened source or we created was Mer And the main reason for that was because I remember was actually getting like all that tension and they were they they were working on these WebAssembly VM for like years and they were like fuck they're very semester Fair So in our company it reads in the ranking Um as we have like everything um basically like we are getting no no no not not of the community gains from that So the open source lucid and I think lucid did a lot of like good Good decisions on um on the way of like running WebAssembly server side I'm actually funny even an offer Wasmer 1.0 we are we are getting back a lot of the learnings that Louis had you said fast but but then we said these also like a great runtime traded by great people 

**Beyang:** Yeah that's great It sounds like you forced their hand a little bit um and and kind of encourage them uh indirectly to release their technologies open source as well 

**Syrus:** Yeah it's it's it's awesome I mean it's it's funny to go like this Uh the politics of of uh of open source are a little bit weird Um and that means kind of like sometimes when you're on the open source space and you have like let's say competing products it's um you always have to fight too busy like window window battle against uh basically who's gonna get the users Um but in general like I will say like The ones that have benefits may benefit most from from these are actually the users right Because when there is more more um more waste of running web as somebody said server side basically they have more choices and with more choices they can choose whatever is best for them It's kind of like the ecosystem just evolves at a faster pace So um so yeah I think it was a very good moment move from from the team to opensource it 

**Beyang:** Yeah I've I've read a lot of kind of internet comment threads where people talk about like the wisdom Wars or things like that It sounds like you know things are really heating up in the space So that's pretty exciting 

**Syrus:** Yeah It's it's funny because it's yeah Uh there wasn't worse have been have been real Yeah It's I wouldn't have never been too much in that I felt like the words were going to be like some other space on the on the thing is at the end It's it's less about like Wars and more about like what we can provide for the users And um in our case I'm like we are 300% focus on like how we can improve the experience of of users using what was on the server side Um in the case of lucid actually like their I will say their main goal is being able to to um supercharge their CDN So that means like the developer experience Might not be as polished because like their focus is somewhere else which is fine It's not like there are different trade offs in each of these approaches 

**Beyang:** totally It seems to me from what I've observed that a wise Mer from the get go has really made developer experience and community building a priority for Uh the company and also the open source project Can you talk a little bit about those efforts around building the community and what the community looks like today 

**Syrus:** So Um when I started Wasmer I realized that this ecosystem or this market was going to get filled by by a lot of uh different yeah Big companies that wanted to basically be part of this space And when you are an underdog that's quite challenging Right It's kind of like how We as a company we are going to be able to survive when Google tries to do something on this space or how we are going to be able to survive when like a billion dollar company like Fazli does something in this space how we are going to be able to win to get users And now at the end I realized community was very very big part of that So um so if you build more or if you focus more on that then it's going to be easier for you to have a good spot on the longterm 

**Beyang:** Yeah Yeah I think one of the efforts that might be related to this um I'm not sure maybe maybe you can clarify but you know the fact that uh or like  w APM the the wisdom package manager that's that's another project that came out of Weizmann right 

**Syrus:** Yes Finally a funny story I actually created our boat wampum one year before I created Wasmer And the main reason for that is I felt like what was happening was going to become big And they were like okay there is no package manager And the package manager is quite important Actually I like to be able to distribute software So there was no package manager I created first of wampum And actually like if you if you analyze or if you compare compare the logo of was myrrh R is yes His license of the Wacom box Um and this is super intentional basically like the main reason for us because actually I created the wampum logo first but but then one of them is this uh packets monitor for for distributing solver created for what was Basically like a it's a package manager is fully the science for the WebAssembly ecosystem because sometimes I I get the question of okay why people will use WAPA man will not use NPM And the main reason I I will I will tell them is when When you asked basically like Python developers if we're running Python programs actually they have to install NPM Almost all of them will will reject that idea and the same you But when you have actually a package manager that is not trying to push you towards any ecosystem right Because what was of these all the ecosystems is all the languages at the same time So we don't want to favor by phone over rust or go over sea We don't want to do that Basically We just want to be a One very easy way to distribute this silver that can be used across different languages So that means like we are not biased against JavaScript and on this kind of like that developers will when when they when they uh try to or when they want to use these universal software they know that we are not trying to push Java script in their pipeline environments for example So so it's it's it's much much uh much uh Proper way or a much easier way to get them using the ecosystem 

**Beyang:** Yeah Can you talk more about the developer experience of using a package a whopping package that's written in a different language because you know for me most of the package managers I've used have been tied to one particular source language So you know if I'm coding and go I want to take a dependency on something It has to be you know a library written and go And if that library doesn't exist yet I have to port You know you know something else written in another language to go which is always you know super annoying Uh what does it look like if I'm writing Python and I want to you know use some other library that might be written in rust  

**Syrus:** So right now there is a standard interface for running like what was humbling We can call these I mean this is called Wasi and this interface is is kind of like similar to POSIX which means kind of like get it as you rights to be able to like open fives within like a sandbox environment but the open files read directories and things things like that So So that means like if you have like a Russ program right now and want to use and you want to use this brass program from Python it could be a CC as visited like compiling your Russ program into web assembling with the Wasi target And then On that promise compiled you just kind of like kind of like execute it directly on the Westmore Python runtime And the mean the cool thing about that is like was Marie even though it's actually made in rust we have integrations with a lot of different languages allows you to use a WebAssembly BM Not only in rust or not only in JavaScript but also in Python or bingo or in a Swift or in Java or in C sharp or basically like wherever you want to use it So that means like first you compile your your um You're work with somebody or you're promising to assembling you have like a micro container Let's say like my program dot wasm and then like from Python you just execute it And right now like we are don't make him super super easy This intercommunication between like the Python program on the Russ forum But there is some work going on that is he's not really jet like the interface types

**Beyang:** Got it So like in the end state it would be something like a you have this kind of mini executable that gets distributed and probably some sorta like lightweight wrapper um in each kind of source language that wraps that many executable So that like you know if I'm using Python I can still uh you know PIP install that rapper package uh and then import it in my pipeline code Just like any other uh Python package Does that kind of experience that you're going for 

**Syrus:** Ideally that will be the end ideal experience So that means kind of like let's go back to they're using I'll use case that I imagine or a forced marriage which was this universal universal graphical library So these universal graphical library could be made in any language that actually can be compiled directly into our assembly which could be like go could be re-asked could be could be C or C plus plus So we first compiled this graphical library into well summit And then we basically like Create the bindings or create like a intermediary later that let us create the bindings for all the different language integrations basically like at one take So that means like you just say okay these are the different functions that like you can call from other languages that are exposed in my in my library And then from different languages do you will have these these functions are exposed and then you just will will interact with with uh or intercommunicate with this library quite quite easily So at the end you will have like one library made in whatever language compiling to assembly and then you will reuse that library in any other language as if it was like them If it was a native a native for library for the language So you don't need to worry about converting types or anything like that 

**Beyang:** Got it That's super cool It's kind of uh maybe roughly analogous to how you know in the JVM if I'm writing Java code uh you know I can use a library that's written in you know closure or uh Kotlin or something else that compiles down to JV and Right 

**Syrus:** Yes That's actually like it's funny about you that you mentioned there the JVM there is actually like one one initiative that is coming from Oracle Quote grotto BM And it's super interesting basically like you know that Java has been always kind of like as low to startup right Because like you have to warm up and yeah Basically I get it's a little bit slower to the syrup and that's and that's fine because their longterm performance is is super awesome But um but the main thing is Right now basically like Oracle is investing a lot of time to be able to pre compile these basically like jars into native code And they did that for basically like the Java language with a with a framework called truffle And then they expanded this framework to be only not using Java but also to understand other languages So funnily enough grab actually right now lets you use a Python and intercommunicate very easily Python with a JavaScript and with Ruby and with and with C and with LBM it's it's crazy Um but they're the main the main uh finger about growl VM is It's basically like you're tied to Oracle Um it's it's basically like you're always having the same problem as as you were having before with the JBM which is kind of like not normally what you want is something that this is the standard that this push by by all the industry I'm not my only one one player 

**Beyang:** Yeah Yeah that's a that makes sense So kind of the selling point of of Wiseman Wiseman over that is uh I get all the portability of the JVM but faster startup times And also I can I can use non JVM languages uh as well 

**Syrus:** Yes Yeah And basically you can use you can use whatever whatever you want One of them one of the things that I think it was hard for the JVM to basically conquer the whole world it was like a lot like adoption on the language side Basically like if you were using Python in Java you have to use the GI phone You can not use your feature 

**Beyang:** yeah 

**Syrus:** And that means like you will have some compiler compatibility issues Hopefully not but like there there probably will be some especially if you're a big company So that that issue of not being able to use that already exists systems I think was a was a deterring factor for the option of a of a JVM 

**Beyang:** yeah Now why why is it that um you know the JVM ran into those uh adoption issues among uh  other languages but uh wisdom Isn't going to run into those same issues that some Design choice in the runtime or 

**Syrus:** It's more of like the the the choices that the people working at these companies did right Like what they wanted this to keep people almost everyone on their ecosystem So when you want to basically like capture people and don't let them out what do you do Did you encourage them to use proprietary things rather than things that already exist Why Because you have more control over them but this on the longterm is actually like resulting to be negative Right Um at the end like we don't it's always good is like using or reusing things that already exist So that means like if the JVM at the beginning they did something to understand basically like LBM bit code for example that could have been like a very very big win for them but they didn't have the incentives to do it because they wanted to capture and keep people within their ecosystem Not going somewhere else 

**Beyang:** Got it So it's kind of like Oracle owns the  JVM runtimes or at least the ones that are um popularly in use uh  in most companies And so they they want to preserve control over that Whereas WebAssembly it started its life as this kind of open standard And there's uh many different implementations of that standard right now So the you don't have to worry about lock-in as much 

**Syrus:** Yeah Just like locking basically like you can just you can reuse over that already exist You're going to use it by phone in one assembly which is awesome Like you don't need to create that Python for WebAssembly explicit Right And that's a very big green because that means you will get the same kind of errors the same issues the same the same things as you get into normal Python So you don't need to spend time worrying about like okay why these in this environment is behaving this very weird way when actually it was suspecting this horror thing So it's the same it's the same 

software 

**Beyang:** as someone who had to run some triathlon code uh back in the day I can vouch for the the the pain that a that kind of extra layer Of um well it's not indirection It's just the realization that what you're running is not actually Python is it's something different And so if you you know Google for error messages or you're trying to debug something you can't really reuse any of the existing Corpus of information Okay cool Yeah that makes sense So we've talked a bit about uh and as compared to the JVM I think like another comp that people make is to Another technology which is a Docker or you know more generally you know LXE and containers Um can you talk about like the comparison and contrasts between web assembly and what containers allow you because with containers they also had this kind of um you know early selling point of like you know write any language run in any environment it's portable it's lightweight you know et cetera et cetera 

**Syrus:** Yes So it's funny that you say that because actually like there they are containers are are not really that much portable So I mean like when you create a container that works in your exec D six machine which is like normally the chips that you have in your laptop this container will not work natively in that era machine That means kind of like the containers are our tips are our tips of dependent but not only that the both Docker containers and LXC containers depend on having like a Linux Linux operating system and under the hood So even if you're running Docker on Mac you're actually Dockery Mac is running a Linux VM and it's under these Linux VMware ULA where you run the containers and the same for LXE LXC actually have like a kernel integration Like you do need a kernel Linux kind of integration and you cannot for example run like Alexi in windows or a Mac So this is the first the first one of the first realizations but I will say the main the main big one is we have two kind of containers The ones that are used until now That are they operating system based containers Um basically like U S scale things things thinking on machines musically how many machines how many VMs are I'm going to have running running this code Um you think of that because actually there is a entity called the operating system that actually lives in each of these these uh these machines Um in the gifts of Wossner or WebAssembly you have to have operating system based containers What do you have is application-based containers And when you remove all the overhead that actually like you require for running operating system then you end up with a much lighter container Um it's light it's much lighter in two ways One is because the containers are actually much more lightweight Um they're it's it's uh they are uh they're a bit smaller in size On the other on the other part of that actually it's a very good selling point for for WebAssembly it's that the circle times are actually quite quick compared to to a Docker containers or Alexi And the main reason for that is when you have a container that it's tell bring the system based container When you start up that actually you have to run a lot of things from the operating system just to start And these in the best of the cases like really on the best of it the cases when for example you use I Cracker which is is very faster kind of run time for for containers created by humans In the best of the case you can you can get 150 milliseconds officer last time When you remove all these overhead then you can end up with much smaller containers Uh and also you can get the containers that can have a much faster run a much faster startup speed So that means like rather than starting the discontinuing 150 milliseconds the container will start in 15 nanoseconds And these when you're running a lot of containers actually matters but I will say It mainly matters because there are new trends that are coming that we all think think or believe are going to important like several lists And right now we are trying to basically like shapes serverless trying to adapt into a structure that actually read that much that match So the main reason for that is right now even these several lists Yeah You are you can use kind of like operating system based containers like the Docker but the main issue there is because the startup time is at least 100 150 milliseconds You cannot start a start up like a container pair HTTP request For example if you want you actually need to use two SRTs They call the approach and the approach That means kind of like what happens if a container is is is get requests like very frequently And what happens if not and this is not optimal But with what was somebody you can actually started like container peer request like doesn't that almost any overhead And that's I think is a very big win And just to to EMP for me then last important thing that I think is going to be converted irrelevant especially on the on the next year is a multi platform site right now If you want to run Docker on windows or if you want to run Docker on Mark you need to have a Linux VM a nerdy kid which basically I got overhead and same for Alexis Basically Alex is you need like Colonel integration And not just that So that means like they're not only eh tips of dependent but are also platform dependent and biggest of web assembly You can have one container that will work exactly the same way in windows that will work exactly the same way Mac Or Linux And at the same time it will work exactly the same way in Linux x86 visited like in your normal tips that you have on servers And it will work in Aaron and fun fact why this is important We all know that For example right now Apple is moving into RM right into the Apple a silicone So and right now we know there are tons of developers that are using Apple laptops actually to develop What do you think will happen when these developers actually will try to use Docker containers on their on their Mac They will see the performance decreased by like five out of five And that's that's that's very good because actually their experience will be much much worse So when you move on the main reason is because actually what they will be doing is simulating an X X 86 machine in their arm into their air MTF set So I mean like basically they're regulating this is not going to be fast in our in in our case we pick them pilot we compile these what was on the code into whatever said and apart from your using So that means like you don't need to worry about like just running at faster speed because you will always run code at the fastest speed available in your chip set 

**Beyang:** Yeah that's a that's actually an angle I hadn't even thought of before If you know companies like Apple are moving to arm  you're going to have this um Kind of bifurcation of arm and x86

**Syrus:** Yeah I mean even before like even if we don't look at that even if we look about like Linux that cannot run in Mac Oh so what are these creating one limo state solution but cannot run in the other Linux distribution which actually is very late by the habits So we remove all these things We can have actually a universal store that will give us binaries that will work everywhere 

**Beyang:** Yeah that's actually one of the big selling points of of go which is a programming language I use quite often it just the ease of cross compilation to different platforms But uh the issue with that is that you know it works as long as you're using go but as soon as you want to use you know another language uh You obviously can't use the go compiler to to create portability for Nongo language Um okay so so you've taught Yeah Sorry go ahead 

**Syrus:** No I was going to say that in the case of go you can actually create like binaries for a lot of platforms or in the case of fellow BMEs also like quite quite similar but the main difference there is actually like you have to maintain you have to distribute all these different binaries for all these different platforms that you want to support Ideally like you just walk this in you will a um distribute one binary and forget 

**Beyang:** Yeah that's fair So you know you you've talked about portability you've talked about um startup time but surely there must be a trade off here Cause you know you're you're introducing a another layer of indirection which is the WebAssembly runtime um you know asthma and in this case what about the performance in kind of the the warm state What sort of you know presumably it's it's No faster than you know running natively So like what what kind of performance hit uh are we talking about 

**Syrus:** So in general basically what we are doing is uh like what what was some of the VMs are doing are compiling these will somebody go to machine code The thing is in general like when you have this level of a structure and there is always like some some overhead in our case basically like when you use we have like multiple kind of compilers And in our in our basically like server side recommended tier we are using a labium So the cool thing about that is we can and reach almost native speeds Their overhead is around like five to 10% slower But there is one one thing one catch here which is actually sometimes it's even faster So we have like one person that it was basically the benchmarking BC and tar a compression on a comp compression And it was comparing the native ones versus versus the them And then whatever somebody wants and basically like this person So like uh um overhead of like on one test was Alexis per se And the other was like 8% In other words like 9% And the other was like means 30% That means like it was more was 30 per person faster than native And you will ask why the fog that happens And the Merissa is because like No it's because of what was somebody 32 beads Actually the pointers are smaller Um um when the point is are as smaller as you can do we're kind of opening up a demonstration on the tip side that you can not do on their 30 day on the 64 bit machines So it means that like sometimes you can even end with faster perhaps 

**Beyang:** Wow That's a that's crazy Another topic that uh comes up in discussions Um I've seen about website leavers Docker is kind of the security topic Uh and there's been a lot of discussion around Docker security in general Um you know I've been privy to a lot of these discussions about you know Docker defaults to running as root And it's not really you know it's it's actually quite easy to break out of the sandbox if if you know what you're doing Um can you can you talk uh talk about you know how WebAssembly And why is where it compares to to that 

**Syrus:** Yeah It one side I will say that actually like Alexi solves that like barrier elegantly So you don't actually need to run Alexi into a or you're going to run that at sea containers in in in in uh I'm privileged Um wait Um but yeah in the guests of Docker basically like Docker just relates everything to operating system That means like it's just like um the findings between like the Docker container on the operating system are minimal Are basically like just transparent Um and that means is when you don't do any kind of like effort to to some box it in there in as a middleman then like this kind of things can can happen in the in the death of Aleksey They they do actually things more smartly when relaying like system calls to the operating system So that means they can assure that the assistant calls that you want to do we have the rights to do that So this isn't the case of uh of Docker versus LXE bat in the guest of honor Docker versus Wossner Um the the main difference is actually like in the walk in in the WebAssembly world when you run WebAssembly programs or WebAssembly modules you actually have to be explicit about it What kind of functions this program can access So that means that by default I want somebody Paramo can not have Any interaction with the host like you cannot call any function in the house So that means like by default if you want to open a file open so or I don't do something something then yours this whatever you are trying to do will not be exposed And the if you want to be exposed if you want to expose that function then you have to be explicit about it So that's the first layer. The other part is what was somebody by default is secure and the secure because it separates what is the executable code from the data And why is this important Sometimes in C you can actually compile code that like given a raw pointer That means kinda like a the direction of data will we'll be able to call that function will be say like be able to call Direction of memory as if it was a function in the case of what was somebody that's impossible in the gist of what was somebody if you want to call upon what you have to do you have to follow the function call either a call or call indirect but you can not call into an explicit part of the memory that is basically just data not executable So on one side you have executable memory which is What where you put the functions and the other side you have data memory That is where you put the data and both are completely separate So given the data memory you cannot you cannot try to call a function there because like what was and that's something that you can do in in the SeaWorld world or or in the in the native world normally So that's another really big distinct distinction that you can basically like you're more protected on the on the WebAssembly space 

**Beyang:** Yeah that's pretty interesting Yeah You know I I just thought of this tweet that I saw a while back it was from uh Solomon hikes uh the founder of of Docker Uh he said something to the effect of you know if WebAssembly had existed uh you know and it wasn't as mature as it is now when Docker was created there would have been no reason to create Docker Alright Are you familiar with that tweet 

**Syrus:** Yes that's funny because I'm actually like when when I started at we got like one one small investment and then this investor introduce us to Solomon And since January I was basically like talking with Solomon and trying to basically he could invest in Plattsburgh and it took him like some some months to realize basically like the power behind like what was humbling And then almost at the same time that we be like Oh what was somebody existed at When I created the Docker I will not create it over busy We upgraded like something something different And at this this moment actually he also decided to invest in the company which was was obviously good because then yeah because then like you can basically like when when you're when you're trading a star album are trying to raise money basically having validation from someone that have created some something that That became big Um that's kind of like a good validation point So that was that was very very good for us 

**Beyang:** Yeah I you know I want to um dig into that more like from your perspective do you think that a wise Mer will supplant a Docker or LXC is kind of the GoTo Um shall we say like virtualization technology or deployment technology uh for you know most uh server side workloads in the next you know like five to 10 years or 

**Syrus:** I believe so Uh that's that's why I'm embedding very very I think having a universal uh platform or a universal format that basically like any computer any tips at any platform can understand The advantage of this of of that are are for super big So so I believe that's that's basically it that's going to be the way that we are going to run silver in the future Why Because it's sandbox by default multi-platform is universal and is fast some so when you put all these things together you're like okay like why we would not use that 

**Beyang:** think there will be a Kubernetes for the wisdom ecosystem Or do you think Kubernetes will just um extend itself to accommodate uh wise in base containers Or you know what are your thoughts on that 

**Syrus:** Um I have very peculiar thoughts first because like where we're um The future of as the company actually goes more on the infrastructure side of what was humbling Mmm I will say that the same way That Docker enabled Kubernetes that means kind of like Corinthians before Docker cannot like didn't make sense Right And co and Docker created a new set needs that were not necessary when you were basically like orchestrating software before I think the same way that like Docker enabled Kubernetes was more will enable other other thing

**Beyang:** Got it That that's super interesting You know it's almost like I look at what Kind of the cloud uh compute players you know the AWS is and Azures and uh you know Cloudflare's of the world are doing and it's almost like you know with Kubernetes uh this layer of obstruction got introduced that kind of prevented them from building their own kind of cloud operating systems If that makes sense So like you know with Kubernetes Yeah there's still some level of stickiness but like it you know as long as you're running on criminality is like it's in theory you know you can switch between cloud providers and it's almost like you know in kind of the serverless mode that's that's kind of their attempt to leapfrog Kubernetes and build kind of more like you know like platform dependent um computing API APIs that bypass Kubernetes I wonder if you know they are all trying to Uh prevent uh Kubernetes like thing from emerging in the wisdom ecosystem It's just like me thinking out loud there 

**Syrus:** It's yeah It's it's funny We got like All of these things When you have ecosystems of the REA exist usefully and you have like new emerging technologies that were not existing when they first technologies were created So that means kind of like what was somebody kind of like the annex is when coroner's was created So what you end doing is kind of like you and trying to adapt So I could read this to be able to run what was humbling which for example Microsoft is trying to do right now Um I personally think that the way that you should scale so where somebody sober is is quite different than the way that you ask or the way that your scale operate operating system containers is quite different than the way that you scale application-based So even though actually you will do these right now because physicians are important and you want to make sure right now you can use what was happening on your Kubernete as workloads And I think that's the optimal thing to do in the longterm 

**Beyang:** Yeah it makes sense Can you talk about what sort of themes and areas Um the Westmore team is going to be focusing on in the next six 12 months 

**Syrus:**  so are trying to do is we want to empower the community We want to make sure everyone wants to use what was on the server side We'll be able to do that And right now it's still quite hard Like even though actually it was more provides the best experience while of assembly Itself as like a system is still quite dark So that means kind of like if you want to compile from Russ to WebAssembly is I mean from Russell robot somewhere right It's quite trivial But if you want to do it from go is not the three-wheel or if you want to do it from other languages it's not a CC So I think like lowering that barrier I'm making super easy for people to use What was the server side Basically that's going to be one of our goals of this year And then on the other side is basically the monetization side How was myrrh as a company will be able to make money because we all know Docker itself even though created a lot of value for a lot of different companies was not able to capture most of the value this value And the main reason is because it's a run time and your users are developers So in the case of was my runtime is is We are hardly going to get any money from this So we need to start researching into other ways of revenue and it's fine It's fine Actually We love it to have like wasn't a time to be completely open served some not a paid product Um but we need to start researching into like what are different ways that we can that we can expand our market and that we can become like a uh If not profitable uh at least like a company that disabled to prove that there is some interest on their on them yeah enterprise side I'm basically like on the on on on that I think for us being able to launch tools that make it super easy for these enterprises to adopt whatever somebody's server side So that's kinda like the things that we want to continue working on but there is always like a part of the community and um basically like giving back that we are very very very big on I think we need to give back if we if we want to grow the 

**Beyang:** Yeah makes makes total sense Um we're almost out of time here but before we go uh I wanted to ask as a last question If someone is listening to this and you know they think Wiseman is super interesting and they want to check it out try it out Uh what should they do Where should they go 

**Syrus:** So we have a website, wasmer.io. They're actually in this website they can find links to uh to uh they get a project They can find that find links to the repo or to their team basically who who's working last summer they can find links to our blog and basically learn like different articles that we that we publish where we compare basically like Wossner versus solid runtimes and where we compare be say like what are they Different trailers that you do when choosing your own Pilar I'm basically like or our learnings So is our life We recommend people to just go to was Mariah sneak there Um we'll have as luck Community channel that I welcome anyone to join is is like the last summer that IO Um and yeah basically like go there ask questions We're like super open and we always want to help We have like a lot of different companies It's small developers using using us And we want to basically make super easy for you to adopt Wossner And if it's not lost even adopting web assembly some so if you join our community or your re visit our website or repo and have I any questions yes Open up a nation in GitHub or or just write a message on Slack and we will reply like very promptly 

**Beyang:** awesome My guest today has been Syrus Akbary. Syurs, thanks for being on the show 

**Syrus:** Thank you very much I really enjoyed chatting today
