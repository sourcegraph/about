<!-- START SUMMARY -->
[Yves Junqeira](https://twitter.com/cetico) and [John Ewart](https://twitter.com/_johnewart) are co-founders of [YourBase](https://yourbase.io/), a build and test runner service that accelerates testing and CI by understanding the implicit dependency graph of your builds. YourBase integrates with most major build tools and employs system call analysis and static language analysis to infer the build dependency structure without the need for manual configuration. It then uses this information to parallelize and cache builds, yielding significant performance improvements.

Yves and John reflect on their experiences working as SRE inside Google and SWE inside Amazon and how writing code is different inside these organizations, both compared to one another and to the rest of the world. They share lessons learned and advice for potential developer tool founders.
