See the [changes](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/about%24+file:%5Edocs/terms-dotcom%5C.md+type:diff&patternType=literal) since the [previous version](https://about.sourcegraph.com/archives/terms-cloud/2022-02-09/) or visit our [archives](https://github.com/sourcegraph/about/tree/main/docs/archives).

Thank you for using Sourcegraph! This page lays out the basic terms and conditions that apply to your use of Sourcegraph Cloud.

<div className="p-3" style={{background: '#f2f4f8', wordWrap: 'break-word'}}>

<span style={{color: '#b200f8'}}>

## Is this the right Terms of Service for me?

</span>

Are you interested in terms for...

- **Sourcegraph Cloud**: You're in the right place! Read on.

- **[A self-hosted Sourcegraph instance](/terms/self-hosted)**: If you’d like to use a self-hosted Sourcegraph instance (e.g. one deployed via the `docker run` command in our [Quickstart](https://docs.sourcegraph.com)) to search, navigate, and analyze your code, rather than the Sourcegraph Cloud instance, or if you’d like to use any products (e.g. browser or editor extensions) developed and distributed by us for use with your self-hosted instance, please see our terms and conditions at https://about.sourcegraph.com/terms-self-hosted.

- **[Sourcegraph OSS](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/master/LICENSE.apache)**: It is possible to run a version of Sourcegraph without some Enterprise features from our open source code available at https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph. If you want to follow the instructions there to build and run Sourcegraph OSS from source, please see the open source license (Apache 2.0) at https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/master/LICENSE.apache.

- **Sourcegraph extensions**: If you’d like to use any extensions made available via our [Extension Registry](https://sourcegraph.com/extensions), please understand that extensions made available by third-parties are not provided by us and are generally governed by separate terms and conditions. Extensions that are developed and distributed by us are governed by these terms and conditions.

- **[Government](/terms/gov)**: Certain features of our software may have their own terms and conditions that you must agree to when you sign up for that particular feature. As an example, if you’re using our software as an employee or contractor of the U.S. Government, our Supplemental Terms for U.S. Government Users at https://about.sourcegraph.com/terms-gov apply. Those terms and conditions supplement these terms and conditions.
</div>

PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY TO ENSURE YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF EACH PROVISION. THE AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.

</span>

<span style={{color: '#777777'}}><i>**Short version**: You’re allowed to use the services for any reasonable purpose (e.g. don’t use it to host illegal content).

If you give us a great idea about how to improve our services, we can use it.</i></span>

3.1 **License from Us to You**.

1. **Grant**. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, we hereby grant to you a limited, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable (except, with respect to Organizations, to your employees and contractors performing services for you or on your behalf) license to access and use the Services in order to review Code Data in the manner contemplated by the Agreement and the Documentation, solely for your internal business purposes. You may only use the Documentation to support your use of the Services. All rights in the Services and Code Data not expressly granted herein are hereby reserved by us.

3. **No Sensitive Data**. You acknowledge and agree that, (i) the Services are not designed to store Sensitive Data (as defined below), and (ii) you will not use the Services to store Sensitive Data. “Sensitive Data” means: (i) special categories of data enumerated in European Union Regulation 2016/679, Article 9(1) or any successor legislation; (ii) protected health information as defined in HIPAA; (iii) payment cardholder information or financial account information, including bank account numbers or other personally identifiable financial information; (iv) social security numbers, driver’s license numbers, or other government identification numbers; (v) other information subject to regulation or protection under specific laws such as the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act or Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) or related rules or regulations; or (vi) any data similar to the above protected under applicable laws.

1. **User-Generated Content**. Some areas of the Services allow users to post Content such as profile information, proprietary Code, comments, reviews, etc. (**“User-Generated Content”** or **“UGC”**) (for clarity, this does not include open source Code as defined by the Open Source Initiative at https://opensource.org/osd). WE CLAIM NO OWNERSHIP OF YOUR UGC. However, you understand that other users may view and interact with your UGC in accordance with your Account settings, and you grant us rights reasonably necessary to do so. We have the right (but not the obligation) to remove any UGC at any time and for any reason.

2. **Grant**. By posting UGC on or through the Services, you grant (and you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant) to Sourcegraph a royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, modify, and publish all such UGC via the Services (including your name, voice, and/or likeness as contained in your UGC) for the limited purposes of:
   (i) providing and improving the Services;
   (ii) protecting the Services to prevent abuse;
   (iii) tailoring the Services to you; and

You’re responsible for obtaining all necessary consents and permissions for any UGC, including Code, that you provide or make accessible to the Services.

4. **Responsibility for UGC**. We take no responsibility and assume no liability for any UGC that you or any other user or third-party posts.

You understand and agree that you may be exposed to UGC that is inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate for children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose, and we’re not liable for any damages you allege to incur as a result.

5. **Private Repositories**. Some Accounts have private repositories, which allow you to control access to Content. We consider the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. Our personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our Privacy Policy. In addition, you may enable additional access to your private repositories to use certain services or features.

By acceptance of your submission, we do not waive any rights to use similar ideas we already had or obtained from other sources.

3.5 **Extensions**. As described above, certain features of the Services may allow you to download software packages from the Extension Registry. These packages may be offered by us or by third-party providers. Packages made available by third-party providers are subject to separate terms and conditions and are not governed by these Terms.

3.6 **Beta Services**. We may make beta and experimental products, features, and Documentation available to you on an early access basis (**“Beta Services”**). Beta Services are not generally available and may contain bugs, defects, and errors. We provide Beta Services “as is,” without warranties, and may discontinue the Beta Services at any time. Our service level agreements do not apply to Beta Services. If and when the Beta Services become generally available, you will have the option to pay for the software or discontinue its use. We may use your feedback about Beta Services.

<span style={{color: '#b200f8'}}>

## 5. Privacy and security

</span>

<span style={{color: '#777777'}}><i>**Short version**: Our privacy policy tells you what you need to know about how we use any personal information you provide to us.

User privacy is important to us. Please read our [Privacy Policy](/terms/privacy) carefully for details relating to how we collect, use, and disclose personal information you provide to us.

We have implemented commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure information you provide us from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your information for improper purposes. You understand that internet technologies have the inherent potential for disclosure. You acknowledge that you provide any sensitive information to us at your own risk.

If you are an Organization established in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom or Switzerland, or otherwise obliged to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation, we will process any information relating to identified or identifiable natural persons in accordance with our [Data Processing Addendum](/dpa), which will be incorporated by reference into the terms of this Agreement.

<span style={{color: '#b200f8'}}>

## 6. Confidentiality

</span>

<span style={{color: '#777777'}}><i>**Short version**: We will each protect the other party's confidential information.</i></span>

6.1 **Definition**. **"Confidential Information"** means all non-public information disclosed by us to you, or vice-versa, that is designated by the discloser as confidential or that reasonably should be considered confidential given the nature of the information or circumstances of its disclosure.

6.2 **Exclusions**. Confidential Information does not include any information that

1. was or becomes publicly known through no fault of the receiving party;
2. was rightfully known or becomes rightfully known to the receiving party without confidential restriction from a third-party that has a right to disclose it;
3. is approved by the disclosing party for disclosure without restriction in a written document or electronic record; or
4. the receiving party independently develops without access to or use of the other party’s Confidential Information.

6.3 **Restrictions on Use and Disclosure**. Neither party will use the other party’s Confidential Information except as permitted under this Agreement. Each party agrees to maintain in confidence and protect the other party’s Confidential Information using at least the same degree of care as it uses for its own information of a similar nature, but in any event at least a reasonable degree of care. Each party agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized disclosure of the other party’s Confidential Information, including, without limitation, disclosing such Confidential Information only to its employees, independent contractors, consultants, and legal and financial advisors (collectively, **“Representatives”**) who (i) have a need to know such information, and (ii) are subject to confidentiality obligations at least as protective of the Confidential Information as the terms of this Agreement. Each party is responsible for all acts and omissions of its Representatives. The foregoing obligations will not restrict either party from disclosing Confidential Information of the other party if required by any governmental body, so long as, to the extent allowed under applicable law, the party required to make the disclosure gives reasonable notice to the other party to enable it to contest the requirement. The restrictions set forth in this Section will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement. The terms of this Section 6 supersede any non-disclosure or confidentiality agreement entered into by the parties prior to the effective date of this Agreement.

## 7. Term; termination

</span>

7.2 **Termination for Breach**. If a party fails to cure a material breach of the Agreement within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice of breach, the other party may then terminate the Agreement within the following thirty (30) days. We will refund you any prepaid, unused fees.

7.3 **Termination for Convenience**. Either party may terminate this Agreement, for any reason or for no reason, provided that you are responsible for all prepaid fees and fees you commit to in an Order Form. If we terminate the Agreement under this section, we will refund you for all prepaid fees for the remainder of the Subscription Period.

7.4 **Effect of Termination; Survival**. Upon termination of this Agreement, you may no longer use the Services, and if any fees were owed prior to termination, you must pay those fees immediately. Any provisions of this Agreement that, by their terms or their nature, should survive the termination of this Agreement shall so survive. For purposes of clarity, your right to use the Services will not survive any termination of this Agreement. Following termination of this Agreement, Sourcegraph will remove your Content from the Services.

## 9. Third party services and software

</span>

<span style={{color: '#777777'}}><i>**Short version**: Third party services and software may be necessary for Sourcegraph Cloud to work (examples include libraries Sourcegraph uses internally, code hosts, authentication providers, external code analyzers, monitoring and tracing tools, etc.).

## 15. Governing law; arbitration; and class action/jury trial waiver

</span>

<span style={{color: '#777777'}}><i>**Short version**: We’re based in California, so the agreement is governed by California law, and all disputes must be brought there. If you have a claim against us, you’ll work with us to arbitrate it on an individual basis instead of via class action or jury trial.</i></span>

15.1 **Governing Law**. The Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of these Terms shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Santa Clara County, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that Santa Clara County, California is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings if the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.

15.2 **Arbitration**. Read this section carefully because it requires the parties to arbitrate their disputes and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us. For any dispute with us, you agree to first contact us at support@sourcegraph.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that we have not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to the Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof, by binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com. The arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California, unless we agree otherwise. If you are using the Services for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this section shall be deemed as preventing us from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, intellectual property or other proprietary rights.

15.3 **Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver**. WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICES FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THE AGREEMENT, WE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.
