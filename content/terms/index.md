Are you interested in terms for...

- **[Sourcegraph](/terms/cloud)**: If you’d like to use Sourcegraph products to write, find, test, and fix code, please see our [Sourcegraph terms and conditions](/terms/cloud). These terms apply to Cody and code search for hosted and self-hosted instances. 

- **[Government](/terms/gov)**: Certain features of our software may have their own terms and conditions that you must agree to when you sign up for that particular feature. As an example, if you’re using our software as an employee or contractor of the U.S. Government, our [Supplemental Terms for U.S. Government Users](/terms/gov) apply. Those terms and conditions supplement these terms and conditions.

- **[Cody](/terms/cody-notice)**: Cody-specific terms that apply to customers who entered into Sourcegraph terms pre-Cody.
