This document outlines the basic terms and conditions that apply to Sourcegraph's Resident Architecture Offerings.

## Resident Architect Terms of Service

### Resident Architect Description
A Sourcegraph expert dedicated to providing strategic technical success planning, tailored ongoing enablement, and hands-on assistance for adoption and utilization of features and activating advanced use cases for customers via direct access to customer systems and teams. This is a customer-defined, tailored collection of Professional Service (PS) activities based on customer needs.

### Resident Architect Scope
#### Resident Architect Contractual Terms
Annual recurring engagement; fixed set of hours per week throughout the subscription term (default: 5 hours a week, 260 hours annually). These hours do not include activities such as planning, reporting, etc. 

Note: hours may be able to flex monthly, subject to planning and based on project needs but should not exceed the annual allocation. Time spent towards the service will be tracked discretely and reported to Finance monthly.

#### Resident Architect Activities
The Resident Architect will perform quarterly and monthly planning with the customer and the assigned Account team to define priorities and goals to be performed under the Resident Architect Service. The activities performed will be custom tailored to the specific needs of the organization. Sample activities that may be performed are:
- Immersive knowledge transfer around Sourcegraph capabilities and best practices relevant to customer teams, 
- Strategic planning around priorities, goals, and KPIs
- Technical partnership on leveraging Sourcegraph capabilities to solve specific technical challenges
- Perform technical tasks on behalf of your teams such as scripting, Batch Change spec creation, Code Insight dashboard development, UI customization, organization and Own utilization, and more
- Custom & tailored enablement for customer teams based on their tech and their needs; train the trainer
- Joint success planning (quarterly) to ensure alignment, outcomes, and value
- Direct technical advocacy back to internal teams on problems and feature requests


### Direct Access
The Resident Architect will perform the determined activities either by working collaboratively with an organization's admin or independently via direct badged-access to the customer's environment. This will be dependent on the organization's desire and ability to grant this access to the Sourcegraph team, and the level of access that can be granted. Access is strongly recommended for this service. If your organization is interested in having Sourcegraph directly access your environment during an implementation, this should be discussed prior to purchasing the service.

### Consumption Rules
The parties agree that the following rules shall apply to the consumption of hours set forth above:
  - (a) Availability: Unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, Professional Services will be performed Monday through Friday, between the hours of 8:00 a.m. â€“ 7:00 p.m. in the Customer's local time zone.
