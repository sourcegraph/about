Thank you for using Sourcegraph! This page lays out the basic terms and conditions that apply to your use of the applications, software, products, and services we make available at Sourcegraph.com.

## Is this the right Terms of Service for me?

</span>

Are you interested in terms for...

- **Sourcegraph.com**: You're in the right place! Read on.

- **[A self-hosted Sourcegraph instance](/terms/self-hosted)**: If you'd like to use a self-hosted Sourcegraph instance (e.g. one deployed via the `docker run` command in our [Quickstart](https://docs.sourcegraph.com)) to search, navigate, and analyze your code, rather than the Sourcegraph.com instance, or if you'd like to use any products (e.g. browser or editor extensions) developed and distributed by us for use with your self-hosted instance, please see our terms and conditions at https://about.sourcegraph.com/terms-self-hosted.

- **[Sourcegraph OSS](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/main/LICENSE.apache)**: It is possible to run a version of Sourcegraph without some Enterprise features from our open source code available at https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph. If you want to follow the instructions there to build and run Sourcegraph OSS from source, please see the open source license (Apache 2.0) at https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/main/LICENSE.apache.

- **Sourcegraph extensions**: If you'd like to use any extensions made available via our [Extension Registry](https://sourcegraph.com/extensions), please understand that extensions made available by third-parties are not provided by us and are generally governed by separate terms and conditions. Extensions that are developed and distributed by us are governed by these terms and conditions.

- **[Government](/terms/gov)**: Certain features of our software may have their own terms and conditions that you must agree to when you sign up for that particular feature. As an example, if you're using our software as an employee or contractor of the U.S. Government, our Supplemental Terms for U.S. Government Users at https://about.sourcegraph.com/terms-gov apply. Those terms and conditions supplement these terms and conditions.
</div>

PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY TO ENSURE YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF EACH PROVISION. THE AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.

## 14. Governing law; arbitration; and class action/jury trial waiver

</span>

<span style={{color: '#777777'}}><i>**Short version**: We're based in California, so the agreement is governed by California law, and all disputes must be brought there. If you have a claim against us, you'll work with us to arbitrate it on an individual basis instead of via class action or jury trial.</i></span>

14.1 **Governing Law**. The Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of these Terms shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Santa Clara County, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that Santa Clara County, California is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings if the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.

14.2 **Arbitration**. Read this section carefully because it requires the parties to arbitrate their disputes and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us. For any dispute with us, you agree to first contact us at support@sourcegraph.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that we have not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to the Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof, by binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com. The arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California, unless we agree otherwise. If you are using the Services for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this section shall be deemed as preventing us from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, intellectual property or other proprietary rights.

14.3 **Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver**. WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICES FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THE AGREEMENT, WE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.
