Thank you for using Sourcegraph! This page lays out the basic terms and conditions that apply to your use of software, products, and services we make available at Sourcegraph.com.

## Is this the right Terms of Service for me?

</span>

Are you interested in terms for...

- **A self-hosted Sourcegraph instance**: You're in the right place! Read on.

- **[Sourcegraph.com](/terms/cloud)**: If you’d like to use Sourcegraph.com (the public Sourcegraph instance that can be used to search, navigate, and analyze public code) rather than a self-hosted instance, or if you’d like to use any products (e.g. browser or editor extensions) developed and distributed by us for use with sourcegraph.com, please see our Sourcegraph.com terms and conditions at https://about.sourcegraph.com/terms-dotcom.

- **[Sourcegraph OSS](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/master/LICENSE.apache)**: It is possible to run a version of Sourcegraph without some Enterprise features from our open source code available at https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph. If you want to follow the instructions there to build and run Sourcegraph OSS from source, please see the open source license (Apache 2.0) at https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/master/LICENSE.apache.

- **Sourcegraph extensions**: If you’d like to use any extensions made available via our [Extension Registry](https://sourcegraph.com/extensions), please understand that extensions made available by third-parties are not provided by us and are generally governed by separate terms and conditions. Extensions that are developed and distributed by us are governed by these terms and conditions.

- **[Government](/terms/gov)**: Certain features of our software may have their own terms and conditions that you must agree to when you sign up for that particular feature. As an example, if you’re using our software as an employee or contractor of the U.S. Government, our Supplemental Terms for U.S. Government Users at https://about.sourcegraph.com/terms-gov apply. Those terms and conditions supplement these terms and conditions.
</div>

PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY TO ENSURE YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF EACH PROVISION. THE AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.

<span style={{color: '#b200f8'}}>

## 6. Confidentiality

</span>

<span style={{color: '#777777'}}><i>**Short version**: You and we will each protect the other party’s confidential information.</i></span>

6.1 **Definition**. **"Confidential Information"** means all non-public information disclosed by us to you, or vice-versa, that is designated by the discloser as confidential or that reasonably should be considered confidential given the nature of the information or circumstances of its disclosure.

6.2 **Exclusions.** Confidential Information does not include any information that

1. was or becomes publicly known through no fault of the receiving party;

2. was rightfully known or becomes rightfully known to the receiving party without confidential restriction from a third-party that has a right to disclose it;

3. is approved by the disclosing party for disclosure without restriction in a written document or electronic record; or

4. the receiving party independently develops without access to or use of the other party's Confidential Information.

6.3 **Restrictions on Use and Disclosure**. Neither party will use the other party's Confidential Information except as permitted under this Agreement. Each party agrees to maintain in confidence and protect the other party's Confidential Information using at least the same degree of care as it uses for its own information of a similar nature, but in any event at least a reasonable degree of care. Each party agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized disclosure of the other party's Confidential Information, including, without limitation, disclosing such Confidential Information only to its employees, independent contractors, consultants, and legal and financial advisors (collectively, **"Representatives"**) who (i) have a need to know such information, and (ii) are subject to confidentiality obligations at least as protective of the Confidential Information as the terms of this Agreement. Each party is responsible for all acts and omissions of its Representatives. The foregoing obligations will not restrict either party from disclosing Confidential Information of the other party if required by any governmental body, so long as, to the extent allowed under applicable law, the party required to make the disclosure gives reasonable notice to the other party to enable it to contest the requirement. The restrictions set forth in this Section will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

<span style={{color: '#b200f8'}}>

## 7. Term; Termination

</span>

<span style={{color: '#777777'}}><i>**Short version**: You may shut down your instance any time. We may terminate the agreement at any time, at which point your right to use the software will immediately expire.</i></span>

7.1 **Subscription Period**. This Agreement starts on the earlier of the date on which you: (a) agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement; or (b) first set up an Instance and will continue in effect until either you or we terminate it (the **“Subscription Period”**).

7.2 **Termination for Breach**. If a party fails to cure a material breach of the Agreement within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice of breach, the other party may then terminate the Agreement within the following thirty (30) days. We will refund you any prepaid, unused fees.

7.3 **Termination for Convenience**. Either party may terminate this Agreement, for any reason or for no reason, provided that you are responsible for all prepaid fees and fees you commit to in an Order Form..

7.4 **Effect of Termination; Survival**. Upon termination of this Agreement, you may no longer use the Software, and if any fees were owed prior to termination, you must pay those fees immediately. Any provisions of this Agreement that, by their terms or their nature, should survive the termination of this Agreement shall so survive. For purposes of clarity, your right to use the Software will not survive any termination of this Agreement.

</span>

<span style={{color: '#777777'}}><i>**Short version**: You’re responsible for any fees associated with your use of Sourcegraph.

8.6 **Renewals**. Unless otherwise stated in an Order Form, your subscription will be automatically renewed and your credit card account (or other payment method account) will be charged as follows without further authorization from you every month, year, or other period you subscribed to.

## 14. Governing law; arbitration; and class action/jury trial waiver

</span>

<span style={{color: '#777777'}}><i>**Short version**: We’re based in California, so the agreement is governed by California law, and all disputes must be brought there. If you have a claim against us, you’ll work with us to arbitrate it on an individual basis instead of via class action or jury trial.</i></span>

14.1 **Governing Law**. The Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of these Terms shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Santa Clara County, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that Santa Clara County, California is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings if the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.

14.2 **Arbitration**. Read this section carefully because it requires the parties to arbitrate their disputes and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us. For any dispute with us, you agree to first contact us at support@sourcegraph.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that we have not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to the Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof, by binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com. The arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California, unless we agree otherwise. If you are using the Software for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this section shall be deemed as preventing us from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, intellectual property or other proprietary rights.

14.3 **Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver**. WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SOFTWARE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THE AGREEMENT, WE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.
