## What is Sourcegraph’s business model?

</span>

We make money through paid subscriptions to use our Services. We do not sell your information.

<span className="text-blurple-400">

## What information do we collect, and for what purpose

</span>

When you interact with our Services, we collect information that could be used to identify you (**“Personal Information”**). Examples include a username and password, an email address, a name, and an IP address.

Some of the information we collect is stored in a manner that cannot be linked back to you (**“Non-Personal Information”**). Non-Personal Information includes aggregated, non-personally identifying information that does not identify a user or cannot otherwise be reasonably linked or connected with them. 

### Information you provide to us directly

When you register for a Sourcegraph account, participate in forums, comment on blog posts, submit a feedback survey, interact with the chat bot on our website, or correspond with us, we may collect account information (username, password, email), profile information (display name, avatar URL), Content you post, add, receive, or share on our hosted services, and any payment information. We do not process or store your payment information, but our third-party payment processor does.

### Information we receive from third parties

We may receive information about you from third-party services if you log in or otherwise interact with our Website or Services through a code host or social media, for example, by liking us on Facebook or following us on Twitter. The data we receive depends on your privacy settings with the third party but can include your name, email, third-party user ID, and location. Review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Service.

### How does Sourcegraph use my information provided directly by me and third parties?

We use information provided directly by you and third parties to operate, maintain, improve, and provide to you the features of the Services. We may use this information to communicate with you, such as to send you email messages, and to follow up with you to offer news and information about our Services. We may also send you Service-related emails or messages (e.g., account verification, change or updates to features of the Services, technical and security notices). For more information about your communication preferences, see [Will Sourcegraph send me emails](#will-sourcegraph-send-me-emails) below.

### Automatically collected information

#### Usage data

When you use our Services, Sourcegraph automatically collects data about the Services and how they are used, including:

* Aggregated and high-level information about usage through a server ping. The server ping sends a payload containing data such as total number of users and whether certain features are enabled or in use. For more information about the specific information we have access to, see our [server pings documentation](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/pings). 
* Event analytics data and metadata to better understand usage within the Services, including click patterns and length and frequency of feature utilization, tied to an internally-generated user ID number.

When you visit our website or use our Services, we may automatically collect the following information.

#### Cookies

When you visit our website or use our Services, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Services. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Services (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click, how frequently you access the Services, and other actions you take on the Services), and allow us to track your usage of the Services over time. For more information, see “Third-party tracking and online advertising” below and our [Cookie Policy](/terms/cookie-policy/).

#### Log data

#### Access, authorization, and activity audit logs

When you visit or use our Services, we may collect information related to accessing systems and data, including IP addresses, usernames, and data accessed. This information is only retained for the purposes of identifying, analyzing, and resolving potential security incidents. Access to this information is limited to those who require access for these purposes and will only be shared with the relevant customers in the event of a security incident.

#### Device data

When you visit or use our Services, we automatically collect information about your device, which may include the type of hardware and software you are using (for example, your operating system and browser type), IP address, and other unique identifiers for devices used to access our Website and Hosted Services.

#### Location data

This is the geographic area where you use your computer or mobile devices (as indicated by an IP address or similar identifier) when interacting with our Services.

#### Email beacons

When we send you emails, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Services.

#### Web analytics

We may also collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Services. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit, your use of third-party applications, and other information that assists us in analyzing and improving the Services.

Although we do our best to honor the privacy preferences of our users, we are not able to respond to Do Not Track signals from your browser at this time.
