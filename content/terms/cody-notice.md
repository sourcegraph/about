**Sourcegraph Cody** is an AI coding assistant that finds, explains, and writes code using deep context from your codebase. Cody uses Sourcegraph’s Code Intelligence Platform and large language models (LLMs) to synthesize responses to user queries. You can access the private **beta** version of Cody through an editor extension. Cody will soon be available within the Sourcegraph application. 

**Accuracy**:  Cody uses context from your codebase to substantially improve the accuracy of its responses compared to other AI-based tools. However, Sourcegraph does not guarantee the accuracy of Cody's answers. 

**Ownership**:  Sourcegraph makes no claims of ownership over the code generated by Cody or the user's existing code. The user retains ownership of their code and responsibility for ensuring their code complies with software licenses and copyright law. Cody may make use of language models trained on large datasets of publicly available code. It is the user's responsibility to verify any code snippets emitted by Cody comply with existing software licenses and copyright law.

**No warranty**:  The beta product may contain bugs, defects, and errors. Notwithstanding any other terms in your agreement with us, we provide the beta version of Cody “as is,” without warranties or indemnity from us. 

**Acceptable use**

You must follow the acceptable use policies of the following LLM providers:

**Other frequently asked questions**
    
1. _What data does Sourcegraph collect when you use Cody?_

    Sourcegraph collects and uses the following data to support and improve user experience:


    **Usage Data** is usage and operations data in connection with your use of Cody, such as metrics on frequency and length of a user feature engagement. Usage Data does not contain personal data other than an anonymous user ID.


    **User Feedback** is any form of feedback that the user submits, including thumbs up and thumbs down clicks and comments or ideas shared for the purpose of giving feedback.


    In addition, when used with Sourcegraph Cloud, Sourcegraph also collects and uses the following data solely to provide the Service:


    **User Prompts** are user submissions to Cody, such as a query or request. Sourcegraph translates the User Prompt into search query syntax and uses the search query syntax to find relevant code snippets in your codebase. Sourcegraph then submits the search query syntax and relevant code snippets  (“**LLM Prompt**”) to a third-party LLM. 


    **Responses** are the outputs returned to you by Cody. 


    For individuals who use the Sourcegraph Cody extension without connecting to a Sourcegraph Cloud or Self-hosted account (“**Sourcegraph Cody Community Edition**”), Sourcegraph also collects the following data, as defined above, to support and improve user experience, though none of it will be used to train any generally available models.

* User Prompts
* LLM Prompts
* Responses


2. _Will my User Prompts or Cody's Responses be used to train any generally available machine learning model?_

    No.

3. _Will my User Prompts to Cody be shared with any third parties?_

    We send LLM Prompts to a third-party LLM provider for the sole purpose of providing you the service. 

4. _Will the LLMs use my prompts to train their models?_

    No, Sourcegraph has obtained commitments from our LLM providers that no Cody prompts will be used to train LLM models.
