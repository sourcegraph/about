**Sourcegraph Cody** is an AI coding assistant that finds, explains, and writes code using deep context from your codebase. Cody uses Sourcegraph’s Code Intelligence Platform and [Anthropic’s](https://www.anthropic.com/) large language model (LLM) to synthesize responses to user queries. You can access the private **beta** version of Cody through an editor extension. Cody will soon be made available within the Sourcegraph application. 

#### **Accuracy**

Cody uses context from your codebase to substantially improve the accuracy of its responses compared to other AI-based tools. However, Sourcegraph does not guarantee the accuracy of Cody's answers. 

#### **Ownership**

Sourcegraph makes no claims of ownership over the code generated by Cody, nor does Sourcegraph claim ownership of the user's existing code. The user retains ownership of their code and responsibility for ensuring their code complies with software licenses and copyright law. Cody may make use of language models trained on large datasets of publicly available code. It is the user's responsibility to verify any code snippets emitted by Cody comply with existing software licenses and copyright law.
