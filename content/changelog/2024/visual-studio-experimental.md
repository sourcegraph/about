This experimental version currently supports chat, and does not support autocomplete or inline editing capabilities.

Cody for Visual Studio is available for Free, Pro, and Enterprise users and is available in the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcegraph.cody-vs). The experimental version currently works for Visual Studio 2022 on Windows only, and you can find out more about features and limitations in our documentation [here](http://sourcegraph.com/docs/cody/clients/install-visual-studio).
