We’re excited to announce the release of Cody for Eclipse! Eclipse devs can now natively work with Cody in their editor, including users on all Cody plans (Free, Pro, and Enterprise). This release is experimental, and it includes Cody’s chat and Prompts functions.

Ask questions about your code, generate code, and fix code all through Cody chat. You can also automate your work with the Prompt Library. Autocomplete and inline editing capabilities will come in a future release.
