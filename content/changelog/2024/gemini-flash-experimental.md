Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental was [announced](https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/google-gemini-ai-update-december-2024/#gemini-2-0) last week, and we’re happy to announce support for Google’s latest model across all plans for Cody chat. Google indicates Gemini 2.0 Flash outperforms Gemini 1.5 Pro on key benchmarks at twice the speed, with promising improvements across [developer-related benchmarks](https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/google-gemini-ai-update-december-2024/#gemini-2-0-flash).

Cody users will now see `Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental` in the model selection list for them to use when using chat, and the model is available in the latest versions of Cody for VS Code, JetBrains, and Cody Web. The new model is only available for Enterprise customers on Cody Gateway and need to upgrade to the latest release (5.11) and use modelConfig.
