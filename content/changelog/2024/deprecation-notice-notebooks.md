The [Notebooks feature](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/notebooks), launched in April 2022, has struggled to gain widespread adoption.

Most customers primarily using Notebooks for "evergreen" documentation. To address this, we created alternatives that should cover about 80% of current use cases:

- Embeddable code snippets linking to Sourcegraph
- Embeddable search result sets
- Export of all Notebooks to Markdown

The Notebook feature will be decommissioned with the October 30 release (Sourcegraph 5 Release 9). If you have any questions, please reach out to your account manager or [support](https://help.sourcegraph.com/hc/en-us).
