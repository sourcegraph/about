The [Notebooks feature](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/notebooks), launched in April 2022, has struggled to gain widespread adoption. We have decided to deprecate the feature so we can focus on other features that are more widely used and valuable.

Most customers primarily using Notebooks for _evergreen documentation_. To address this, we created alternatives that should cover about 80% of current use cases:

- Embeddable code snippets linking to Sourcegraph
- Embeddable search result sets
- Export of all Notebooks to Markdown

The Notebook feature will be decommissioned with the October 30 release (Sourcegraph 5 Release 9). If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to your account manager or [support](https://help.sourcegraph.com/hc/en-us). Thank you.
