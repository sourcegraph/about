Cody now supports the updated Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3.5 Haiku models across all plans.

[Anthropic notes](https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use) that the upgraded version of Claude 3.5 Sonnet has significant gains over its predecessor in coding. Claude 3.5 Haiku matches the performance of Claude 3 Opus on many evaluations at a similar speed to the previous generation of Haiku, meaning that users now get significant reasoning power with snappier responses.

Cody users can access these models on the latest versions of the VS Code and JetBrains extentions. Cody Enterprise users can upgrade their instance to v5.9 or later and [make changes to their site admin configuration](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/cody/clients/model-configuration) to use the new models.
