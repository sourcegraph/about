Cody now supports the updated Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3.5 Haiku across all plans.Anthropic notes that this upgraded version of Sonnet has significant gains over its predecessor in coding, and the Claude 3.5 Haiku matches the performance of Claude 3 Opus, on many evaluations at a similar speed to the previous generation of Haiku. Cody users can access these models on the latest version of VSCode and JetBrains. Cody Enterprise users need to upgrade their instance and make changes on their site admin configuration to use the new models.
