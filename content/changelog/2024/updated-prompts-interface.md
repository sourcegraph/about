Hot on the heels of the updates [we rolled out to VS Code](https://sourcegraph.com/changelog/new-prompts-ui), the improvements we’ve made to the Cody sidebar are now available for JetBrains and Cody Enterprise users. Prompt and command use and discovery has been simplified, and we’ve tidied up the display of draft Prompts so that only drafts you own will appear in the UI.

You may notice that the functionality of Prompts largely overlap with commands. We intend to phase out commands in an upcoming release in favor of Prompts and the Prompt Library.
