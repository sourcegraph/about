We're phasing out the Cody Ignore experimental feature. You'll still be able to manually select files for context and choose what's sent to the LLM. This approach simplifies our context retrieval process, reducing overall complexity. We will continue to develop [Cody context filters](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/cody/capabilities/ignore-context#cody-context-filters) for enterprise use.
