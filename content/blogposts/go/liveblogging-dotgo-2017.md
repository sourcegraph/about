We’re excited to be running the official liveblog for dotGo 2017 in Paris on Monday, November 6. With the help of volunteer Gophers at dotGo in Paris, we’ll be  blogging [concise technical summaries](/go) of all dotGo talks, so people from all around the world can follow along and learn. Liveblogging conferences is a tradition in the Go community going back to the very first dotGo and GopherCon in 2014, and we’re excited to be continuing it.

Some highlights from GopherCon 2017: 12 Gophers contributed liveblogs for 26 talks, including [gRPC in Production by Alan Shreve](/blog/grpc-in-production-alan-shreve) and [The New Era of Go Package Management by Sam Boyer](/go/the-new-era-of-go-package-management/).

If you’re at dotGo, stop by and say hello! For those of you at home, follow the action on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sourcegraph) or follow the posts at [https://about.sourcegraph.com/go](/go).
