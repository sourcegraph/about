We are Sourcegraph, known
to our Developers as "[a great source code browsing/discovery tool, especially for large codebase like k8s](https://twitter.com/VladimirVivien/status/1032099627078696960)", and "[like Google's internal code search but for rest of us](https://twitter.com/tsaha/status/1032016464583131136)". We help developers write better software by giving them IDE like features in code hosts such as GitHub and Bitbucket server, both for Open Source and private repositories.

We're proud to once again be hosting the **official liveblog for GopherCon** so we're looking for attendees who want to contribute. Is that you?

## About liveblogging

Liveblogging is hugely beneficial for the presenters, the bloggers, and those reading them.

It's about capturing the most important parts of a talk so people from all around the world can follow along and learn.

As a liveblogger for a talk, you'll get your own dedicated seat, and the task of summarizing the talk will help you process and more deeply understand the content. We'll also tweet out a link to the liveblog post, crediting you and raising your profile to the thousands of developers who follow us on Twitter and the liveblog.

## How being a liveblogger works

1. You apply to be a liveblogger for one of more talks.
2. We'll let you know the talk(s) you'll be covering.
3. After the talk, you'll add your markdown content and images to a GitHub repo.
4. Once ready, we'll post it to our blog and tweet a link to it, crediting you and linking to your Twitter or GitHub.

## To apply

Contact me at [ryan@sourcegraph.com](mailto:ryan@sourcegraph.com) or tweet at [@sourcegraph](https://twitter.com/sourcegraph) and [@ryan_blunden](https://twitter.com/ryan_blunden), whatever is easiest.
