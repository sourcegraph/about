**Update:** Sourcegraph now uses [Sourcegraph extensions](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/extensions) for language support. This blog post has been removed to avoid confusion.

We're still eager to sponsor people to build and improve open source, LSP-based language servers. [Contact us](/contact) if you're interested, either as a part-time effort or to [join our team](https://github.com/sourcegraph/careers) as a full-time member.
