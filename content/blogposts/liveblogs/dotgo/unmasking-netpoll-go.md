Go is a great language for writing network servers. Cindy's talk explains what under the hood when you call `http.ListenAndServe`.

*Editor's note: Cindy's talk was fantastic and full of great visual diagrams to explain complex network implementation concepts. We couldn't do it justice by liveblogging it on the fly. Instead, we recommend you refer to Cindy's blog posts below and her soon-to-be-posted slides and talk video.*
