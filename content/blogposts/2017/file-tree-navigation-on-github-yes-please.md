We've added a file tree to GitHub so that you can quickly explore an entire repository and jump between files without taking your hands off the keyboard.

Get started by downloading the [Sourcegraph for GitHub Chrome extension](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/integration/browser_extension?hl=en)

And then jump into a repository [https://github.com/hootsuite/atlantis/](https://github.com/hootsuite/atlantis/blob/master/cmd/bootstrap.go)

**Pro Tips:**

* Use “Option+T/Alt+T” to show/hide the file tree
* Navigate with arrow keys to expand or collapse directories
* Customize your features by clicking the Sourcegraph icon in the toolbar

*Note: To ensure the best user experience, we disable our features by default if we detect that another installed extension interferes with ours. You can always re-enable features in the options menu.*
