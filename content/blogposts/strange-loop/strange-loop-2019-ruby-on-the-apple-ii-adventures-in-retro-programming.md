title: "Strange Loop 2019 - Ruby on the Apple II: Adventures in Retro Programming"
description: "The minimum system requirements for PowerPoint 2019 are 4 GB of RAM and a 1.6 GHz CPU. The system requirements for this talk are a few kilobytes of RAM, a 5 1/4\" floppy disk drive, and a 30 year old computer.  With an 8-bit CPU running at 1 megahertz and kilobytes of RAM, the Apple ][ was a humble machine. Many people first learned to program on it, but the languages designed for the Apple ][ tended to be clumsy and limiting by modern standards. Surely it isn't possible to fit a language as dynamic, rich, and complicated as Ruby on such a limited machine, right?  Come see Ruby running where it has never run before, learn how programming was done decades ago."

## Overview

The minimum system requirements for PowerPoint 2019 are 4 GB of RAM and a 1.6 GHz CPU. The system requirements for this talk are a few kilobytes of RAM, a 5 1/4\" floppy disk drive, and a 30 year old computer.  With an 8-bit CPU running at 1 megahertz and kilobytes of RAM, the Apple ][ was a humble machine. Many people first learned to program on it, but the languages designed for the Apple ][ tended to be clumsy and limiting by modern standards. Surely it isn't possible to fit a language as dynamic, rich, and complicated as Ruby on such a limited machine, right?  Come see Ruby running where it has never run before, learn how programming was done decades ago.
