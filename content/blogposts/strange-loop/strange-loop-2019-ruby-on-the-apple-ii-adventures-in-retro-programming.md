description: "The minimum system requirements for PowerPoint 2019 are 4 GB of RAM and a 1.6 GHz CPU. The system requirements for this talk are a few kilobytes of RAM, a 5 1/4\" floppy disk drive, and a 30 year old computer.  With an 8-bit CPU running at 1 megahertz and kilobytes of RAM, the Apple ][ was a humble machine. Many people first learned to program on it, but the languages designed for the Apple ][ tended to be clumsy and limiting by modern standards. Surely it isn't possible to fit a language as dynamic, rich, and complicated as Ruby on such a limited machine, right?  Come see Ruby running where it has never run before, learn how programming was done decades ago."

## Overview

The minimum system requirements for PowerPoint 2019 are 4 GB of RAM and a 1.6 GHz CPU. The system requirements for this talk are a few kilobytes of RAM, a 5 1/4\" floppy disk drive, and a 30 year old computer.  With an 8-bit CPU running at 1 megahertz and kilobytes of RAM, the Apple ][ was a humble machine. Many people first learned to program on it, but the languages designed for the Apple ][ tended to be clumsy and limiting by modern standards. Surely it isn't possible to fit a language as dynamic, rich, and complicated as Ruby on such a limited machine, right?  Come see Ruby running where it has never run before, learn how programming was done decades ago.

AWESOME LIVEBLOG CONTENT HERE!

<!-- Note on images
  Images (e.g. my_image.jpg) should be put in the `website/static/blog/strange-loop-2019` directory, with the path to the image in your post being `/blog/strange-loop-2019/my_image.jpg`. If you'd rather host the images somewhere else for ease of use, that's fine too.

  Please also try to keep your images to a reasonable size by:
    - Using JPEG compression, unless image is mostly solid color 
    - JPEG compression set between 60%-80%
    - Resizing the image to be no wider then 750px
    - If PNG, use a tool like ImageOptim (https://imageoptim.com/mac) to optimize the file size

  I suggest re-sizing and compressing all the images in one batch as a last step.
