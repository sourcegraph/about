## Overview

Inspired by a love of rainbows and silly tech projects, I decided to make my own first wearable tech - a wedding dress full of lights that could be controlled by tweets from my friends and family! This talk will go over the tech I used (suitable for absolute beginners), the mistakes I made and the lessons I learnt. From using the Twitter API, writing my own API, coding for an Arduino and wiring the whole thing up to the worst bit - THE SEWING. I aim to share the message that it is ok to make mistakes, we all do! If you keep trying you can make something magical!

AWESOME LIVEBLOG CONTENT HERE!

<<<<<<<< HEAD:content/blogposts/liveblogs/strange-loop/strange-loop-2019-tweet-my-wedding-dress.md
<!-- Note on images
  Images (e.g. my_image.jpg) should be put in the `website/static/blog/strange-loop-2019` directory, with the path to the image in your post being `/blog/strange-loop-2019/my_image.jpg`. If you'd rather host the images somewhere else for ease of use, that's fine too.

  Please also try to keep your images to a reasonable size by:
    - Using JPEG compression, unless image is mostly solid color
    - JPEG compression set between 60%-80%
    - Resizing the image to be no wider then 750px
    - If PNG, use a tool like ImageOptim (https://imageoptim.com/mac) to optimize the file size

  I suggest re-sizing and compressing all the images in one batch as a last step.
