title: "Strange Loop 2019 - Privacy Governance & Explainability in ML/AI"
description: "Since the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect in May 2018, matters of data privacy have grown from minor organizational adjustments to enterprise-level initiatives with impact on innovation and day-to-day operations alike. While privacy compliance may be straightforward in some areas, the growth and expansion of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) have has created an impasse between consumer data and processes that are, to say the least, difficult to fully explain. Integrating processes with ML and AI techniques often prove to significantly benefit the accuracy and efficiency of processes and decision making, but one's ability to fully understand precisely how an output was generated or a decision was made for an individual is much easier said than done. Yet, regulators across the globe are challenging businesses to explain how they are using governance techniques to protect consumer data privacy and to explain how decision making within ML/AI is impacting consumers. How can one identify bias? What processes can be introduced to protect consumer privacy while rooting out potential bias in the underlying models? In this talk, we will explore methods for enhancing privacy and governing data that is used for ML/AI, as well as to consider procedural approaches available for rooting out bias and building a foundation for consumer confidence in an otherwise complex and opaque space."

## Overview

Since the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect in May 2018, matters of data privacy have grown from minor organizational adjustments to enterprise-level initiatives with impact on innovation and day-to-day operations alike. While privacy compliance may be straightforward in some areas, the growth and expansion of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) have has created an impasse between consumer data and processes that are, to say the least, difficult to fully explain. Integrating processes with ML and AI techniques often prove to significantly benefit the accuracy and efficiency of processes and decision making, but one's ability to fully understand precisely how an output was generated or a decision was made for an individual is much easier said than done. Yet, regulators across the globe are challenging businesses to explain how they are using governance techniques to protect consumer data privacy and to explain how decision making within ML/AI is impacting consumers. How can one identify bias? What processes can be introduced to protect consumer privacy while rooting out potential bias in the underlying models? In this talk, we will explore methods for enhancing privacy and governing data that is used for ML/AI, as well as to consider procedural approaches available for rooting out bias and building a foundation for consumer confidence in an otherwise complex and opaque space.

AWESOME LIVEBLOG CONTENT HERE!

<!-- Note on images
  Images (e.g. my_image.jpg) should be put in the `website/static/blog/strange-loop-2019` directory, with the path to the image in your post being `/blog/strange-loop-2019/my_image.jpg`. If you'd rather host the images somewhere else for ease of use, that's fine too.

  Please also try to keep your images to a reasonable size by:
    - Using JPEG compression, unless image is mostly solid color 
    - JPEG compression set between 60%-80%
    - Resizing the image to be no wider then 750px
    - If PNG, use a tool like ImageOptim (https://imageoptim.com/mac) to optimize the file size

  I suggest re-sizing and compressing all the images in one batch as a last step.
