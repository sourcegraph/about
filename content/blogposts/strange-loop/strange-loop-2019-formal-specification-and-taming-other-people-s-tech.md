## Overview

Formal specifications are not just for academics and have applications way beyond checking algorithms like Paxos and Raft. Join us for a tour of using formal specifications for every day system design. If you've ever configured a load balancer or a message queue then you're already doing the kind of engineering work that formal specifications were intended for. This talk tells the story of a real life in production system built with common open source technologies that was struggling with growth and how we untangled its built-in assumptions and reworked its design using formal specifications.

AWESOME LIVEBLOG CONTENT HERE!
<<<<<<<< HEAD:content/blogposts/liveblogs/strange-loop/strange-loop-2019-formal-specification-and-taming-other-people-s-tech.md

<!-- Note on images
  Images (e.g. my_image.jpg) should be put in the `website/static/blog/strange-loop-2019` directory, with the path to the image in your post being `/blog/strange-loop-2019/my_image.jpg`. If you'd rather host the images somewhere else for ease of use, that's fine too.

  Please also try to keep your images to a reasonable size by:
    - Using JPEG compression, unless image is mostly solid color
    - JPEG compression set between 60%-80%
    - Resizing the image to be no wider then 750px
    - If PNG, use a tool like ImageOptim (https://imageoptim.com/mac) to optimize the file size

  I suggest re-sizing and compressing all the images in one batch as a last step.
