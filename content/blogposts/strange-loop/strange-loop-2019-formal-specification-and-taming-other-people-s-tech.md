title: "Strange Loop 2019 - Formal Specification and Taming Other People's Tech"
description: "Formal specifications are not just for academics and have applications way beyond checking algorithms like Paxos and Raft. Join us for a tour of using formal specifications for every day system design. If you've ever configured a load balancer or a message queue then you're already doing the kind of engineering work that formal specifications were intended for. This talk tells the story of a real life in production system built with common open source technologies that was struggling with growth and how we untangled its built-in assumptions and reworked its design using formal specifications."

## Overview

Formal specifications are not just for academics and have applications way beyond checking algorithms like Paxos and Raft. Join us for a tour of using formal specifications for every day system design. If you've ever configured a load balancer or a message queue then you're already doing the kind of engineering work that formal specifications were intended for. This talk tells the story of a real life in production system built with common open source technologies that was struggling with growth and how we untangled its built-in assumptions and reworked its design using formal specifications.
