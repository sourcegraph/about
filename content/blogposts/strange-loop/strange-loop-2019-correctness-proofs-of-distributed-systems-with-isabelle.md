title: "Strange Loop 2019 - Correctness proofs of distributed systems with Isabelle"
description: "Testing systems is great, but tests can only explore a finite set of inputs and behaviors. Many real systems, especially distributed systems, have a potentially infinite state space. If you want to be sure that a program does the right thing in all possible situations, testing is not sufficient: you need proof. Only mathematical proof, e.g. by induction, can cover an infinite state space."

## Overview

Testing systems is great, but tests can only explore a finite set of inputs and behaviors. Many real systems, especially distributed systems, have a potentially infinite state space. If you want to be sure that a program does the right thing in all possible situations, testing is not sufficient: you need proof. Only mathematical proof, e.g. by induction, can cover an infinite state space.
