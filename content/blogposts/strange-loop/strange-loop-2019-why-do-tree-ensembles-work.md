title: "Strange Loop 2019 - Why do tree ensembles work?"
description: "Ensembles of decision trees (e.g., the random forest and AdaBoost algorithms) are powerful and well-known methods of classification and regression. This talk will survey work aimed at understanding the statistical properties of decision tree ensembles, with the goal of explaining why they work. After sketching the algorithms, we will give an initial explanation for their effectiveness via generic arguments (bias-variance decomposition, Hoeffding's inequality), then proceed to more detailed topics (the interpretation of random forests as kernel machines, the role of the margin, interpolation). The audience is expected to have some experience with supervised learning and statistical arguments."

## Overview

Ensembles of decision trees (e.g., the random forest and AdaBoost algorithms) are powerful and well-known methods of classification and regression. This talk will survey work aimed at understanding the statistical properties of decision tree ensembles, with the goal of explaining why they work. After sketching the algorithms, we will give an initial explanation for their effectiveness via generic arguments (bias-variance decomposition, Hoeffding's inequality), then proceed to more detailed topics (the interpretation of random forests as kernel machines, the role of the margin, interpolation). The audience is expected to have some experience with supervised learning and statistical arguments.

AWESOME LIVEBLOG CONTENT HERE!

<!-- Note on images
  Images (e.g. my_image.jpg) should be put in the `website/static/blog/strange-loop-2019` directory, with the path to the image in your post being `/blog/strange-loop-2019/my_image.jpg`. If you'd rather host the images somewhere else for ease of use, that's fine too.

  Please also try to keep your images to a reasonable size by:
    - Using JPEG compression, unless image is mostly solid color 
    - JPEG compression set between 60%-80%
    - Resizing the image to be no wider then 750px
    - If PNG, use a tool like ImageOptim (https://imageoptim.com/mac) to optimize the file size

  I suggest re-sizing and compressing all the images in one batch as a last step.
