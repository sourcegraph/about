description: "Using abstract interpretation to build a scalable tool from scratch is a daunting engineering task that generally requires a protracted development effort. To streamline that process, we built (SPARTA)1, a C++ library of components for building high-performance static analyzers that can run in a production environment. SPARTA provides the building blocks so an engineer can focus solely on the logic that extracts the desired information from the program. The library ensures that the resulting analysis is sound, efficient, and scalable."

## Overview

Using abstract interpretation to build a scalable tool from scratch is a daunting engineering task that generally requires a protracted development effort. To streamline that process, we built (SPARTA)1, a C++ library of components for building high-performance static analyzers that can run in a production environment. SPARTA provides the building blocks so an engineer can focus solely on the logic that extracts the desired information from the program. The library ensures that the resulting analysis is sound, efficient, and scalable.

AWESOME LIVEBLOG CONTENT HERE!
<<<<<<<< HEAD:content/blogposts/liveblogs/strange-loop/strange-loop-2019-easy-abstract-interpretation-with-sparta.md

<!-- Note on images
  Images (e.g. my_image.jpg) should be put in the `website/static/blog/strange-loop-2019` directory, with the path to the image in your post being `/blog/strange-loop-2019/my_image.jpg`. If you'd rather host the images somewhere else for ease of use, that's fine too.

  Please also try to keep your images to a reasonable size by:
    - Using JPEG compression, unless image is mostly solid color
    - JPEG compression set between 60%-80%
    - Resizing the image to be no wider then 750px
    - If PNG, use a tool like ImageOptim (https://imageoptim.com/mac) to optimize the file size

  I suggest re-sizing and compressing all the images in one batch as a last step.
