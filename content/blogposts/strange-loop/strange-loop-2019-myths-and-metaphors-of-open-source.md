title: "Strange Loop 2019 - Myths and Metaphors of Open Source"
description: "Open Source Software (OSS) is built on a rich history of myths and metaphors. This talk will examine these myths and metaphors, and how physical metaphors can lead us astray in a digital world. It will also explain why Open Source Software is not a vending machine, and how OSS development and distribution platforms can impact the value people place on open source software. Clojurists Together is an organisation created to help support and grow critical open source Clojure software. This talk will discuss our experience growing Clojurists Together and some insights it has given us."

It will also explain why Open Source Software is not a vending machine, and how OSS development and distribution platforms can impact the value people place on open source software. Clojurists Together is an organisation created to help support and grow critical open source Clojure software. This talk will discuss our experience growing Clojurists Together and some insights it has given us.
