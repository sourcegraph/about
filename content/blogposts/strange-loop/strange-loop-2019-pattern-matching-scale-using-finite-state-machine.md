## Overview

Working with data often means trying to locate data that fits patterns, akin to finding a needle in a haystack. When we add big data from non homogenous sources to the mix, this problem becomes exponentially complex. One of the use cases at Netflix, is about improving the Sign Up experience through experimentation. Being able to find user journeys across billions of events; that follow certain patterns, is a key insight into simplifying the sign up process.

AWESOME LIVEBLOG CONTENT HERE!
<<<<<<<< HEAD:content/blogposts/liveblogs/strange-loop/strange-loop-2019-pattern-matching-scale-using-finite-state-machine.md

<!-- Note on images
  Images (e.g. my_image.jpg) should be put in the `website/static/blog/strange-loop-2019` directory, with the path to the image in your post being `/blog/strange-loop-2019/my_image.jpg`. If you'd rather host the images somewhere else for ease of use, that's fine too.

  Please also try to keep your images to a reasonable size by:
    - Using JPEG compression, unless image is mostly solid color
    - JPEG compression set between 60%-80%
    - Resizing the image to be no wider then 750px
    - If PNG, use a tool like ImageOptim (https://imageoptim.com/mac) to optimize the file size

  I suggest re-sizing and compressing all the images in one batch as a last step.
