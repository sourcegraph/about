title: "Strange Loop 2019 - InferenceQL: AI for data engineers, without the math"
description: "Can we empower data engineers to use AI to explore, monitor, clean, and predict data streams, without having to learn math? InferenceQL was made by some of the same people behind BayesDB and Empirical Systems, first presented at Strange Loop in 2015. Unlike BayesDB, InferenceQL is not a database, but instead can be embedded alongside data tables, data streams, and client-side web applications. We are just starting to seek external beta testers, contributors, and volunteers."

## Overview

Can we empower data engineers to use AI to explore, monitor, clean, and predict data streams, without having to learn math? InferenceQL was made by some of the same people behind BayesDB and Empirical Systems, first presented at Strange Loop in 2015. Unlike BayesDB, InferenceQL is not a database, but instead can be embedded alongside data tables, data streams, and client-side web applications. We are just starting to seek external beta testers, contributors, and volunteers.

AWESOME LIVEBLOG CONTENT HERE!

<!-- Note on images
  Images (e.g. my_image.jpg) should be put in the `website/static/blog/strange-loop-2019` directory, with the path to the image in your post being `/blog/strange-loop-2019/my_image.jpg`. If you'd rather host the images somewhere else for ease of use, that's fine too.

  Please also try to keep your images to a reasonable size by:
    - Using JPEG compression, unless image is mostly solid color 
    - JPEG compression set between 60%-80%
    - Resizing the image to be no wider then 750px
    - If PNG, use a tool like ImageOptim (https://imageoptim.com/mac) to optimize the file size

  I suggest re-sizing and compressing all the images in one batch as a last step.
