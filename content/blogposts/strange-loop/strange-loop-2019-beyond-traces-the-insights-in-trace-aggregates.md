title: "Strange Loop 2019 - Beyond traces: the insights in trace aggregates"
description: "The value proposition for distributed tracing is well-understood: assembling and visualizing end-to-end transactions helps to identify latency bottlenecks and provides a head-start on problem diagnosis. However, traditional tracing practices enable data presentation at the granularity of only a single transaction. This data is useful for debugging specific issues, but it is difficult to draw conclusions about the overall system without knowing how representative a lone trace is. Instead, aggregating these traces can reveal much more, and can do so with greater precision and certainty."

## Overview

The value proposition for distributed tracing is well-understood: assembling and visualizing end-to-end transactions helps to identify latency bottlenecks and provides a head-start on problem diagnosis. However, traditional tracing practices enable data presentation at the granularity of only a single transaction. This data is useful for debugging specific issues, but it is difficult to draw conclusions about the overall system without knowing how representative a lone trace is. Instead, aggregating these traces can reveal much more, and can do so with greater precision and certainty.
