This talk presents novel programming constructs for probabilistic AI that automate and hide difficult mathematical and numerical details from the user. These constructs are analogous to automatic differentiation for deep learning, but apply to a broader class of AI approaches that exhibit more aspects of human-like intelligence and can work without any training data."

## Overview

What if it were possible to do state-of-the-art AI programming without having to do math? This talk presents novel programming constructs for probabilistic AI that automate and hide difficult mathematical and numerical details from the user. These constructs are analogous to automatic differentiation for deep learning, but apply to a broader class of AI approaches that exhibit more aspects of human-like intelligence and can work without any training data.

AWESOME LIVEBLOG CONTENT HERE!
<<<<<<<< HEAD:content/blogposts/liveblogs/strange-loop/strange-loop-2019-new-programming-constructs-for-probabilistic-ai.md

<!-- Note on images
  Images (e.g. my_image.jpg) should be put in the `website/static/blog/strange-loop-2019` directory, with the path to the image in your post being `/blog/strange-loop-2019/my_image.jpg`. If you'd rather host the images somewhere else for ease of use, that's fine too.

  Please also try to keep your images to a reasonable size by:
    - Using JPEG compression, unless image is mostly solid color
    - JPEG compression set between 60%-80%
    - Resizing the image to be no wider then 750px
    - If PNG, use a tool like ImageOptim (https://imageoptim.com/mac) to optimize the file size

  I suggest re-sizing and compressing all the images in one batch as a last step.
