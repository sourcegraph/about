[Cody for JetBrains v6.0.14](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9682-cody-ai-coding-assistant-with-autocomplete--chat) is now available! This release includes quality-of-life updates to how shortcuts are displayed in the plugin and several bugfixes.

## Updates to shortcut hints

We‚Äôve made several changes to keyboard shortcut hints to make sure they‚Äôre helpful without being distracting.

### Shortcuts on startup

The plugin now displays a welcome message with shortcut hints on startup to help new and returning users jump back into using Cody.

### Edit command actions now show shortcuts after running

After running an Edit Code action, Cody presents four options:

- Accept 
- Undo
- Edit & Retry (adjust your edit prompt)
- Show Diff

The post-edit UI now shows the keyboard shortcuts for each action.

### Removed inline edit command hints

Previously, Cody displayed an Edit Code hint (`Ctrl + Alt + ‚Üµ to Edit`) inline with any code you had highlighted. We heard your feedback that this shortcut was often distracting, so we‚Äôve removed it.

## Bug fixes

### Cmd+Enter correctly triggers code edits

The `Cmd + ‚Üµ shortcut` for running the Edit Code command was not working for some users. This bug is now fixed.

### "Cody is disabled on this file" messaged

The message ‚ÄúCody is disabled on this file‚Äù appeared in error for some users. This message pertains to Context Filters, a Cody Enterprise feature, and it should only appear when an admin has restricted files. This bug is now fixed.

## Changelog

See the [changelog](https://github.com/sourcegraph/jetbrains/releases/tag/v6.0.16) and [GitHub releases](https://github.com/sourcegraph/jetbrains/releases) for a complete list of changes.
