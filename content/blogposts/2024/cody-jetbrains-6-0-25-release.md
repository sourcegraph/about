[Cody for JetBrains v6.0.25](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9682-cody-ai-coding-assistant-with-autocomplete--chat) is now available! This update brings the new Ask Cody to Fix button plus adds compatibility for JetBrains 2024.2 versions.

## Ask Cody to Fix

Cody now makes it even faster to go from seeing an error in your IDE to writing a fix. For errors in your code, Cody presents a new button: Ask Cody to Fix. When you click it, Cody will review the issue and suggest a fix. You can then view the diff of changes and accept or undo the change.

## Compatibility for JetBrains 2024.2 versions

Earlier this week, new versions of JetBrains IDEs began rolling out including IntelliJ 2024.2 and GoLand 2024.2. This update makes the Cody plugin compatible with these 2024.2 versions, so we recommend upgrading Cody if you upgrade your JetBrains IDE to a 2024.2 version.
