Claude 3 Sonnet is the faster model, but produces answers with a lower level of intelligence.

Claude 3 Opus (recommended) is the most powerful model, providing the highest quality code output and answer quality.

## Improved Document Command

Generating documentation from code has been improved to automatically detect documentable code blocks and provide hints to quickly generate doc strings. When your cursor is on a documentable symbol in JavaScript, TypeScript, Go or Python, a "Opt/Alt+D to Document" ghost text will appear. Pressing Opt/Alt+D will immediately generate documentation for that code block.
