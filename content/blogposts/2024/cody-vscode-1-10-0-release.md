## New debug options

We've made it easier to generate and access Codyâ€™s debug logs, allowing you to debug issues and more easily share that information with Sourcegraphâ€™s support team. Please include logs in your bug reports when possible.

- Debug commands are now grouped in command palette under "Cody Debug"
- Added an "Open Output Channel" sidebar menu item, that opens the VS Code output panel with "Cody by Sourcegraph" selected
- Added a debug button in the top right of the Cody settings panel, which sets `{"cody.debug.verbose": true}` and opens the VS Code output panel

## Improved Document Command

Generating documentation from code has been improved to automatically detect documentable code blocks and provide hints to quickly generate doc strings. When your cursor is on a documentable symbol in JavaScript, TypeScript, Go or Python, a "Opt/Alt+D to Document" ghost text will appear. Pressing <kbd>Opt</kbd> / <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> will immediately generate documentation for that code block.
