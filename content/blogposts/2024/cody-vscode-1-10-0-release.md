## Improved Document Command

Generating documentation from code has been improved to automatically detect documentable code blocks and provide hints to quickly generate doc strings. When your cursor is on a documentable symbol in JavaScript, TypeScript, Go or Python, a "Opt/Alt+D to Document" ghost text will appear. Pressing <kbd>Opt</kbd> / <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> will immediately generate documentation for that code block.
