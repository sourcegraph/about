Are you curious about the latest advancements in AI and how they're transforming the world of dev tools? Look no further than [our upcoming meetup on June 24th](https://lu.ma/ai-devtools-night), where we'll discuss these exciting topics with a lineup of industry experts.

Our first speaker, [Dane Schneider](https://twitter.com/danenania), will be discussing [Plandex](https://plandex.ai/) an open source, terminal-based AI coding engine that helps you complete large tasks, work around bad output, and maximize productivity. If you want to build complex software with LLMs, then this talk is for you.

ðŸ”´ Next up, we have Ado Kukic, who will be giving a live demonstration of [s0.dev](http://s0.dev/), which compares which LLM works best for your AI coding cases.

ðŸ”´ Finally, YK will take the stage to discuss whether AI is replacing software engineering jobs and the future of AI in coding.

This meetup is a unique opportunity to learn from AI dev tool leaders, network with like-minded professionals, and gain valuable insights into the future of AI and software engineering.
