Dane Schneider from PlandexAI kicked off the series of talks with a compelling presentation on the evolution of prompts as a new kind of programming language. He demonstrated Plandex, an AI coding engine designed to handle large, complex tasks that span many files and model responses. Dane emphasized the importance of precision and iteration in prompt engineering, likening it to traditional programming. He showcased Plandex's unique features, such as its ability to manage multiple model responses and its integration with version control systems, making AI development more streamlined and efficient.

### Adam Chan from Weaviate

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/itsajchan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@itsajchan</a> talking about <a href="https://twitter.com/weaviate_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@weaviate_io</a> and open source vector search! <a href="https://t.co/ZvuK8ciJzc">pic.twitter.com/ZvuK8ciJzc</a></p>&mdash; Beyang (@beyang) <a href="https://twitter.com/beyang/status/1805415679455281230?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 25, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Adam Chan introduced the concept of vector databases and how they enhance search capabilities by leveraging semantic meaning. He explained how traditional keyword search often falls short in delivering relevant results, whereas vector search uses machine learning models to represent information as vectors, capturing the semantic relationships between data points. This method enables more accurate and relevant search results, especially for complex queries. Adam highlighted Weaviate's innovative approach to improving search functionalities and knowledge management in modern applications, demonstrating its potential to significantly change how we interact with and retrieve information.

### Dani Grant, CEO of Jam.dev
