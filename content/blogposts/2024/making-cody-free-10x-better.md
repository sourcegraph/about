Every month, [Cody](https://sourcegraph.com/cody) helps devs all over the world write millions of lines of code, helping you stay in flow, read and write code faster, and ultimately build amazing software. 

We love seeing all the cool things you’re doing with Cody. But when we looked at our data, we saw a problem that we didn’t love: too many devs were regularly hitting the Cody Free usage limitations. Cody is a tool designed to help _every_ dev, not only those who upgrade to Cody Pro.

To make Cody more helpful for every dev, we’re changing the Cody Free tier to make it **10x better**: 

* We’re scrapping the limit on code completions. Every tier of Cody, including Cody Free, now gets unlimited AI-generated autocomplete
* You get 10x the number of chats and commands every month, 200 instead of 20
* We’re giving you model choice. Choose from Mixtral, Gemini 1.5, Claude 3 Haiku, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet

Previously, Cody Free defaulted to Claude 3 Sonnet. We’re bringing the ability to hot-swap models from Cody Pro to free users, so you can find the **best models** to fit your preferences. Whether you prefer a faster model or a larger, more capable model, Cody Free now has options for you.

This change is **now live**. If you’re a Cody Free user, all you need to do is upgrade your client to the latest version (VS Code v1.24.0 or JetBrains nightly 6.0.8) to get the updates. If you don’t yet have Cody, [get started today](https://sourcegraph.com/cody).

## Want even more Cody?

If you try out Cody Free and decide you want even more, you can upgrade to Cody Pro $9/user/month. The Pro tiers gives you:

* Unlimited chat and commands
* The **most expansive** model choice, including Claude 3 Opus and GPT-4o
