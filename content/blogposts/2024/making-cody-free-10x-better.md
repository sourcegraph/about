Every month, [Cody](https://sourcegraph.com/cody) helps devs all over the world write millions of lines of code, helping you stay in flow, read and write code faster, and ultimately build amazing software. 

We love seeing all the cool things you’re doing with Cody. But when we looked at our data, we saw a problem that we didn’t love: too many devs were regularly hitting the Cody Free usage limitations. Cody is a tool designed to help _every_ dev, and we want to ensure that the free tier is more helpful to devs.

To do this, we’re changing the Cody Free tier to make it **10x better**: 

* **Unlimited code completions:** We’re scrapping the limit on code completions. Every tier of Cody, including Cody Free, now gets unlimited AI-generated autocomplete
* **10x more chats and commands:** You now get 200 chats and commands every month, up from 20
* **Model choice:** Cody Free users can now choose which model to use, including Mixtral, Gemini 1.5, Claude 3 Haiku, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet

Previously, Cody Free defaulted to Claude 3 Sonnet. We've updated the default to Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and we’re bringing the ability to hot-swap models from Cody Pro to free users, so you can choose the **best models** to fit your preferences. Whether you prefer a faster model or a larger, more capable model, Cody Free now has options for you.

This change is **now live**. If you’re a Cody Free user, all you need to do is upgrade your client to the latest version (VS Code v1.24.0 or JetBrains nightly 6.0.8) to get the updates. If you don’t yet have Cody, [get started today](https://sourcegraph.com/cody).

## Want even more Cody?

If you try out Cody Free and decide you want even more, you can upgrade to Cody Pro for $9/user/month. The Pro tier gives you:

* Unlimited chat and commands
* The **most expansive** model choice with flagship models, including Claude 3 Opus and GPT-4o
