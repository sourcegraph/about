Every month, [Cody](https://sourcegraph.com/cody) helps devs all over the world write millions of lines of code, helping you stay in flow, read and write code faster, and ultimately build amazing software. 

We love seeing all the cool things you’re doing with Cody. But when we looked at our data, we saw a problem that we didn’t love: too many devs were regularly hitting the Cody Free usage limitations. Cody is a tool designed to help _every_ dev, not only those who upgrade to Cody Pro.

To make Cody more helpful for every dev, we’re changing the Cody Free tier to make it **10x better**: 

* We’re scrapping the limit on code completions. Every tier of Cody, including Cody Free, now gets unlimited AI-generated autocomplete
* You now get 10x the number of chats and commands every month, 200 instead of 20
* We’re giving you model choice. Choose from Mixtral, Gemini 1.5, Claude 3 Haiku, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet

Previously, Cody Free was limited to a single model (Claude 3 Sonnet), and only Cody Pro had model choice. We’re bringing this feature to Free users so you can find the **best models** to fit your preferences, whether a faster or more capable one.

This change is **now live**. If you’re a Cody Free user still seeing the lower rate limits, upgrade your client to the latest version (VS Code v1.24.0 or JetBrains nightly 6.0.8). If you don’t yet have Cody, [get started today](https://sourcegraph.com/cody).

## Want even more Cody?

If you try out Cody Free and decide you want even more, Cody Pro is still available. For $9 / user / month, you get:

* Unlimited chat and commands
* The **most expansive** model choice, including Claude 3 Opus and GPT-4o

## Cody for Enterprise

Finally, if you're looking for a deployment that's suited to the needs of your enterprise, we offer Cody Enterprise, which includes:

* Remote context retrieval for your entire codebase
* Universal support for code hosts
* Support for BYO LLM key, Amazon Bedrock, and Azure OpenAI
* Proven enterprise scale and security, including [context filters](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/cody/capabilities/ignore-context#cody-context-filters), SSO, audit logs, and more
