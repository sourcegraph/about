[Cody for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcegraph.cody-ai) v1.2.0 is now available and includes updated chat history navigation, redesigned chat message editing, improved chat context limit handling, and a number of other bug fixes and improvements.

## Chat: Updated chat list and a new history button

The chats sidebar now groups your chats by when they were last updated, so you can more easily find your recent chats at a glance:

/>

We‚Äôve also added a new Chat History button at the top of your chat tabs, so you can navigate between chats (and search chats) without opening the Cody sidebar:

A big thank you to [Deepak Kumar](https://github.com/deepak2431) for contributing to these changes!

## Chat: Removal of slash commands in chat

We have removed slash commands from the chat interface; however, they are still executable from the Cody sidebar, command palette, and context menu.

This also means that typing '/' in chat no longer displays a list of commands.

When executing a default command, you can see the underlying prompt instead of the command name. This enhancement offers improved visibility by allowing you to discern the underlying prompt when executing a default command. This increased visibility enables you to adjust the prompt using the new editing process.

## Chat: Redesigned chat editing

We‚Äôve updated the chat interface to make it easier to edit chat messages or start a new chat quickly:

<Video
  source={{
    mp4: 'blog/vscode-v1-2-0-blog/video-001'
  }}
  loop={true}
  title="Chat: Redesigned chat editing"
/>

You can now hit Enter to edit your message immediately without waiting for the stream to finish. This allows for quicker experimentation and iteration and less dependence on sending follow-up messages to clarify your question (which can also fill up your chat‚Äôs context window).

We‚Äôve also fixed several chat editing bugs, including the ability to @-include files, run slash commands, and show the edit buttons more consistently in the transcript:

<Video
  source={{
    mp4: 'blog/vscode-v1-2-0-blog/video-002'
  }}
  loop={true}
  title="Chat: Redesigned chat editing"
/>

## Chat: Improved context window handling

We‚Äôve made several changes to the handling of the context window behind chats:

* The allocation of the LLM context window used for transcript messages has been expanded, so chats are now better at remembering past contexts.
* The context limit error-like notifications in chat have been removed while we investigate better ways of giving you visibility on what is included or excluded from context.


## Edits: Relabeled action buttons

The action buttons that appear after performing a Cody code edit have been relabeled to be clear, and ‚ÄúEdits Applied‚Äù is now called ‚ÄúShow Diff‚Äù:

/>

## Custom command (beta) updates

We‚Äôve made some changes to custom commands:

* Support for running custom edit commands from the chat window has been fixed.
* Removed the `context.codebase` custom command property based on low usage.
