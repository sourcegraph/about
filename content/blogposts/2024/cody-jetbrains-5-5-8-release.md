[Cody for JetBrains v5.5.8](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9682-cody-ai-coding-assistant-with-autocomplete--chat) is now available! Weâ€™ve updated the multi-repo context selector, improved the extension stability for Apple silicon users, and addied tooltips for new autocomplete users.

## New multi-repo context interface for Cody Enterprise

Cody has a new UI for adding remote repositories as context. The interface is faster and makes it easier for Cody Enterprise users to find their relevant repositories.

You can now:

- Select up to 10 repositories at the same time
- Pick repositories from a populated list
- See which Sourcegraph server youâ€™re logged into from the UI

## Stability improvements for Apple silicon users

Weâ€™ve fixed a bug where the extension would crash for Mac users with Apple silicon CPUs, particular users on M2 chipsets. Cody is now more stable for those users. 

If you continue running into any issues with Cody crashing, please [let us know](https://community.sourcegraph.com/).


## Autocomplete tooltips for new users

We added a tooltip for new users to make it easier to get started with autocomplete. The tooltip shows the hotkeys for accepting and cycling through suggestions for new users when theyâ€™re shown their first suggestion.
