[Cody for JetBrains v5.5.8](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9682-cody-ai-coding-assistant-with-autocomplete--chat/versions/stable/530630) is now available! This update includes a new interface for selecting multiple remote repositories to use as context, stability improvements for Apple silicon users, updates to context windows, and new autocomplete tooltips.

## New multi-repo context interface for Cody Enterprise

Cody has a new UI for adding remote repositories as context. The interface is faster and makes it easier for Cody Enterprise users to find their relevant repositories.

You can now:

- Select up to 10 repositories at the same time
- Pick repositories from a populated list
- See which Sourcegraph server youâ€™re logged into from the UI

## Stability improvements for Apple silicon users

Weâ€™ve fixed a bug where the extension would crash for Mac users with Apple silicon CPUs, particular users on M2 chipsets. Cody is now more stable for those users. 

If you continue running into any issues with Cody crashing, please [let us know](https://community.sourcegraph.com/).


## Autocomplete tooltips for new users

We added a tooltip for new users to make it easier to get started with autocomplete. The tooltip shows the hotkeys for accepting and cycling through suggestions when you get your first suggestion.

## Expanded context windows for Free and Pro users

JetBrains IDEs now support the expanded context windows we [recently introduced in VS Code](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/cody-vscode-1-14-0-release#bigger-and-better-context-windows-to-improve-chat). Free and Pro users can now push _way more context_ into Cody, so you can ask questions about larger amounts of code, include larger files in context, and have longer back-and-forth chat conversations without losing context. It also means you shouldnâ€™t see Codyâ€™s responses getting cut off mid-answer anymore.


## Changelog

See the [changelog](https://github.com/sourcegraph/jetbrains/releases/tag/v5.5.8) and [GitHub releases](https://github.com/sourcegraph/jetbrains/releases) for a complete list of changes.
