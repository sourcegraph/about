Anthropic [just released](https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use) a new, upgraded version of Claude 3.5 Sonnet, their most powerful language model. Anthropic notes that this upgraded model version has significant gains over its predecessor in coding, making it a perfect candidate to bring to Cody.

Most impressively, Anthropic notes that the new Claude 3.5 Sonnet model scores 49.0% on [SWE-bench Verified](https://www.swebench.com/) compared to the prior version's score of 33.4%.

[Cody](https://sourcegraph.com/cody), our AI coding assistant, prioritizes offering devs the best and latest models. The AI space is a fast-moving field, and model interoperability lets Cody continuously improve as new models come to market.

## Upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonnet is available for all Cody users

The new version of Claude 3.5 Sonnet is now available for all Cody users, including Cody Free, Cody Pro, and Cody Enterprise. It's also the new default model, so if you were previously using the default model (the older 3.5 Sonnet), you should automatically be moved to the new version.
