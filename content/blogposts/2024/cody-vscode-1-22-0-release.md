[Cody for VS Code v1.22](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcegraph.cody-ai) is now available. This update brings support for two of Googe‚Äôs latest Gemini 1.5 models, Flash and Pro. It also adds buttons for quickly adding current codebase or file context to your chat, plus some UI tweaks to clearly show what files Cody is using as context.

## Support for Gemini 1.5 Flash + Gemini 1.5 Pro

Google recently announced new models in the Gemini family, including Gemini 1.5 Flash and Gemini 1.5 Pro. Both of these models are now available to Cody Pro users in VS Code.

[Gemini 1.5 Flash](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/flash/) is a lightweight model built for speed and efficiency. [Gemini 1.5 Pro](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/pro/) is a larger model optimized for high performance across many tasks. You‚Äôll find Flash under the ‚ÄúOptimzed for Speed‚Äù LLM menu and Pro under ‚ÄúOptimized for Accuracy.‚Äù 

Both Gemini models use expanded context windows (the same ones we introduced for the Claude 3 models in [v1.14.0](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/cody-vscode-1-14-0-release)):

* 30,000 tokens of user-defined context
* 15,000 tokens of input context

Try them out and let us know what you think!

## Quickly add @codebase and @file to chat

As you‚Äôre chattingwith Cody, oucan prompt Cody to use specific context by typing @&lt;repository> or @&lt;file>. When you start a _new_ chat with Cody, both your current repository and current file are pre-populated in the chat window. 

We‚Äôre making it easier to add these @-mentions to the chat window for followup messages (or in case you accidentally delete them).

When you type `@` in the chat window, you‚Äôll now see ‚ÄúCurrent Codebase‚Äô and ‚ÄúCurrent File‚Äù in the dropdown, and clicking them adds the respective @-mentions to the chat.

## See the exact context used for followup messages

When you start a new chat in Cody, you‚Äôll see a message showing the context that‚Äôs used to respond to the first question. For followup messages after that point, only _net-new_ context would be shown as a line item in the chat. This was meant to show that all previous context _plus_ the new context was used, but this wasn‚Äôt super clear.

Now, Cody shows net-new context and will mention that prior messages are also being used as context, making it super clear that context used earlier in a thread is not lost of discarded for followups.
