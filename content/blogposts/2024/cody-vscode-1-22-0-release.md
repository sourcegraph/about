[Cody for VS Code v1.22](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcegraph.cody-ai) is now available. This update supports two of Google‚Äôs latest Gemini 1.5 models, Flash and Pro. It also adds buttons for quickly adding the current codebase or file context to your chat and some UI tweaks to clearly show what files Cody is using as context.

## Support for Gemini 1.5 Flash + Gemini 1.5 Pro

Google recently announced new models in the Gemini family, including Gemini 1.5 Flash and Gemini 1.5 Pro. Both models are now available to Cody Pro and Enterprise users in VS Code.

[Gemini 1.5 Flash](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/flash/) is a lightweight model built for speed and efficiency. [Gemini 1.5 Pro](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/pro/) is a larger model optimized for high performance across many tasks. Flash is under the ‚ÄúOptimized for Speed‚Äù LLM menu, and Pro is under ‚ÄúOptimized for Accuracy.‚Äù 

Both Gemini models use expanded context windows (the same ones we introduced for the Claude 3 models in [v1.14.0](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/cody-vscode-1-14-0-release)):

* 30,000 tokens of user-defined context
* 15,000 tokens of input context

Try them out, and let us know what you think!

## Quickly add @repository and @file to chat

While using chat in Cody, you can prompt it to use specific context by typing @\<repository\> or @\<file\>. When you start a _new_ chat with Cody, your current repository and file are pre-populated in the chat window.

We‚Äôre making it easier to add these @-mentions to the chat window for follow-up messages (or in case you accidentally delete them).

When you type `@` in the chat window, you‚Äôll see ‚ÄúRepository‚Äú and ‚ÄúCurrent File‚Äù in the dropdown. Clicking them adds the respective @-mentions to the chat.

## See the exact context used for follow-up messages

When you start a new chat in Cody, you‚Äôll see a message showing the context used to respond to the first question. For follow-up messages after that point, only _net-new_ context was shown as a line item in the chat previously.  The chat would actually use all previous and new contexts, but this wasn‚Äôt clear.

Now, Cody shows net-new context and mentions that prior messages are also being used as context, making it more evident that prior context in a thread is preserved for follow-ups.
