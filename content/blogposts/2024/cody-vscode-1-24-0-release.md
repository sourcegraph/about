[Cody for VS Code v1.24](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcegraph.cody-ai) is now available. This update introduces a new way of showing code edits, displaying inline diffs after edits are complete. Weâ€™ve also updated the chat UI with context chips, added Claude 3.5 Sonnet to the list of LLMs, and more.

## Inline diff view and animation for Codyâ€™s inline edits

When you run a command that involves editing code inline, youâ€™ll now see a progressive animation as Cody makes edits. Youâ€™ll also see inline diffs directly in your file as soon as the command finishes so you can see exactly what happened and accept or decline the edit.

Prior to v1.24, this is how code edits appeared:
<Video
  source={{
    mp4: 'blog/cody-vscode-1-24-release/edits-changes-before'
  }}
  loop={true}
/>

Now, Cody will show inline diffs when the edit is complete:
<Video
  source={{
    mp4: 'blog/cody-vscode-1-24-release/edits-changes-after'
  }}
  loop={true}
/>

## @-mentions are now chips in the chat UI

Weâ€™ve beautified the chat UI with new context chips. The context you @-mention will appear in the chat window with a chip and a symbol indicating the type of context it is (like repo, file, symbol, or webpage context).

## ICYMI: Claude 3.5 Sonnet is here

Last week, we [released Claude 3.5 Sonnet for Cody Pro](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/claude-3.5-sonnet-now-available-in-cody). Cody supports the **best models**, and Anthropicâ€™s latest flagship is already showing [impressive benchmarks](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet), surpassing Claude 3 Opus in some benchmarks while being far faster. Cody Pro users can now select Claude 3.5 Sonnet for chat and commands (this was shipped in VS Code v1.22.4, but is also available in v1.24.0).

## Changelog
