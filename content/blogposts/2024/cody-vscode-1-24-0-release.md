[Cody for VS Code v1.24](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcegraph.cody-ai) is now available. This update introduces a new way of showing code edits, displaying inline diffs after edits are complete. We've also updated the chat UI with context chips, added Claude 3.5 Sonnet to the list of LLMs, and more.

## Inline diff view and animation for Cody's inline edits

When you run a command that involves editing code inline, you'll now see a progressive animation as Cody makes edits. You'll also see inline diffs directly in your file as soon as the command finishes so you can see exactly what happened and accept or decline the edit.

## @-mentions are now chips in the chat UI

We've beautified the chat UI with new context chips. The context you @-mention will appear in the chat window with a chip and a symbol indicating the type of context it is (like repo, file, symbol, or webpage context).

## ICYMI: Claude 3.5 Sonnet is here

Last week, we [released Claude 3.5 Sonnet for Cody Pro](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/claude-3.5-sonnet-now-available-in-cody). Cody supports the **best models**, and Anthropic's latest flagship is already showing [impressive benchmarks](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet), surpassing Claude 3 Opus in some benchmarks while being far faster. Cody Pro users can now select Claude 3.5 Sonnet for chat and commands (this was shipped in VS Code v1.22.4, but is also available in v1.24.0). JetBrains users will also get access to Claude 3.5 Sonnet in the coming days
.
## Upgraded Cody chat experiences across every interface and editor

Today, Cody looks a little bit different everywhere it exists: in VS Code, in JetBrains, and on the web. We want to unify this experience, making Cody chat more polished everywhere while speeding up our ability to release Cody for new IDEs.

We're doing this using Cody's webview-based VS Code UI, which we plan to port to JetBrains, the web, and two new clients: Visual Studio and Eclipse. Today, we released the first step of this plan with an [upgraded Cody web view](https://sourcegraph.com/cody/chat). Cody's web chat now supports model selection, context chips, and reflects the same UI as the VS Code chat sidebar. Try it out and let us know what you think!
