Today, Cody helps devs all over the world write millions of lines of code every month, increasing flow and productivity, and ultimately helping them build amazing software faster.

To help devs do this better, we are excited to announce that today, we are making our Cody Free tier **10x better**. Specifically Cody Free users now have:
- 200 chat/command uses per month, up 10x from 20
- Unlimited autocompletes, up from 500 autocompletes per month
- The ability to choose from select models such as the Mixtral, Gemini, and Claude 3 family of models.

We're especially excited about giving users the ability to choose from a selection of models, previously a feature exclusive to our Cody Pro tier. Now, devs can choose between different models that suit their needs, whether its a faster model or a more capable one.

### Looking for more power?

If you're looking for even more, Cody Pro can be a great choice. At just $9 per user per month, devs get:
- Unlimited chats and commands
- Access to powerful models like Claude 3 Opus and GPT-4o

### Cody for Enterprise

Finally, if you're looking for a deployment that's suited to the needs of your enterprise, we offer Cody Enterprise, which offers:
- Universal support for code hosts
- Code intelligence for large codebases
- Proven enterprise scale and security
