Today, Anthropic [announced](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet) their latest large language model: Claude 3.5 Sonnet. This model’s reasoning skills outperform Anthropic’s previous flagship model—Claude 3 Opus—while being roughly twice as fast as Opus.

Cody, our AI coding assistant, is built on the principle of choice, and we’re committed to bringing the best models and best context into your IDE with Cody. To that end, we’re making Claude 3.5 Sonnet available today in Cody Pro. Pro users can now hot-swap their model to 3.5 Sonnet for chat, commands, and code edits with unlimited usage.

Anthropic’s [announcement blog](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet) cites impressive benchmarks for graduate-level reasoning and coding performance for 3.5 Sonnet, beating out even Claude 3 Opus in both cases. Using [s0.dev](http://s0.dev/), we can see how 3.5 Sonnet compares against other high-intelligence models for coding questions using public repositories:
