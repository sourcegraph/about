Today, Anthropic [announced](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet) their latest large language model: Claude 3.5 Sonnet. This model’s reasoning skills outperform Anthropic’s previous flagship model—Claude 3 Opus—while being roughly twice as fast.

[Cody](https://sourcegraph.com/cody), our AI coding assistant, is built on the principle of choice, and we’re committed to bringing the **best models** and **best context** into your IDE with Cody. To that end, we’re making Claude 3.5 Sonnet available today in Cody Pro. Pro users can now hot-swap their model to 3.5 Sonnet for chat, commands, and code edits with unlimited usage.
