[Cody for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcegraph.cody-ai) v1.8.0 is now available and includes support for Claude 3, local Ollama models, @-mentioning line numbers, keybindings for custom commands, and automatic updating of the local search index.


## Support for Claude 3

For Cody Pro users, Cody now supports the new [Claude 3](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family) models Opus and Sonnet for Chat, Code Editing and Commands.

Claude 3 Sonnet is the faster model, but produces answers with a lower level of intelligence.

Claude 3 Opus (recommended) is the most powerful model, providing the highest quality code output and answer quality.

## Local Ollama models for chat and commands (experimental)

Cody now supports using [Ollama](https://ollama.com) to run local models for chat and commands, available for Cody Pro users. To setup Cody chat to use Ollama:

1. Download Ollama from https://ollama.com/download
2. Launch Ollama (ensure the Ollama logo appears in your menu bar)
3. Pull a model down from the [Ollama Library](https://ollama.com/library) (e.g. `ollama pull gemma:7b-instruct-q4_K_M`)
4. In your Cody VS Code extension settings, set `cody.experimental.ollamaChat` to `true`
5. Open a new chat in Cody
6. In the new chat panel, you should see the chat model you've pulled in the dropdown list

## @-file now supports line numbers

You can now specify line numbers when you @-mention files in chat, by appending ':line-range' after the file name. This allows you to @-mention parts of large files, and makes it clearer what code Explain Code and Find Code Smells commands are referring to.

## Keybinding support for custom commands

You can now bind keyboard shortcuts to quickly run your custom commands. To bind a keyboard shortcut, open the Keyboard Shortcuts editor and search for "cody.command.custom." to see the list of your custom commands.

## Automatic updating of local search index

The local search index, used by Cody Free & Cody Pro, now automatically updates every 24 hours to ensure up-to-date code is used for context, reducing the number of confusing or inaccurate responses.
