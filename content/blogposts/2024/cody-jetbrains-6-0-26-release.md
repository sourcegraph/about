## Ask Cody to Fix, now on Windows

The Ask Cody to Fix button )[released in v6.0.25](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/cody-jetbrains-6-0-25-release)) is now available on Windows. With just a single button, you can go from seeing an error in your IDE to implementing a fix.

## âœ¨ Preview: a new Cody sidebar is coming to JetBrains

A good AI coding assistant should fit seamlessly into your workflow, reducing toil without adding complexity to your work. For Cody to achieve this, we believe it needs a UX that is fast, intuitive, and consistent regardless of where you work with it.

In the next JetBrains update (coming the first week of September), the Cody sidebar will receive a significant UI overhaul to match the one [recently released on VS Code](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/cody-vscode-1-28-0-release).
