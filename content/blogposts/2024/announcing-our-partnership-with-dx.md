Software development becomes more complex every year. Enterprise developers deal with growing codebases, distributed teams, and sprawling dependencies, leading to developers spending more time trying to understand their codebase rather than focusing on what they love to do - writing code and tackling new challenges. 
 
Sourcegraph is built to help enterprise developers work more effectively in these large, complex codebases. Our platform helps developers search, understand, and write code, accelerating the inner development loop. Understanding the exact impact of Sourcegraph is critical for engineering leaders among our customers, including the leaders at Booking.com, who use Sourcegraph’s AI code assistant to speed up their developer workflows. 

While Sourcegraph offers our own in-product analytics, we want to help our customers get an even broader, unbiased view of the impact our platform has on overall developer productivity and satisfaction. To that end, we’re excited to announce our partnership with [DX](https://getdx.com/). DX is an engineering intelligence platform that gives engineering leads and platform teams the data they need to take the right actions to drive higher ROI per developer. Together with DX, we’re excited to help engineering leaders get a third-party assessment of the impact of Sourcegraph and how it empowers their dev teams.

## Partnering with DX

Bringing Sourcegraph together with DX enables engineering teams to precisely quantify the impact that Sourcegraph is having on their dev teams. Customers of Sourcegraph + DX will gain unique access to DX’s measurement and benchmarking capabilities to help optimize their use of the Sourcegraph platform. We invite all of our customers at Sourcegraph to leverage DX for an unbiased measurement of the current state of productivity and the benefits of Sourcegraph’s platform to their organization.

Like Sourcegraph, DX is committed to helping reduce engineering toil and increase velocity for dev teams, and we’re excited to partner with them. As a part of this partnership, DX will also broadly study Sourcegraph’s impact on developer productivity, and they’ll share their learnings with the broader engineering community. 

## Customer case study: Booking.com’s use of Sourcegraph + DX

Booking.com is already seeing the benefits of bringing Sourcegraph together with DX. Their engineering leadership team looked to quantify the impact that [Sourcegraph’s AI code assistant](https://sourcegraph.com/cody) was having on their software development teams, and they were able to use DX to measure output, time savings, and satisfaction of Sourcegraph users.

Here’s an overview of what Booking saw in their data:

- Daily active users of Sourcegraph had a 16% higher PR merge rate than non-users
- At the current levels of adoption and utilization, Sourcegraph is saving 50,000+ dev hours on an annualized basis, with an opportunity to recoup 25,000+ hours of additional time savings.
- Dev Satisfaction with Sourcegraph increased by 31.3% over a 6-month period, a testament to recent product enhancements

After [posting about their 90%+ participation rate](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/beganovicemir_at-bookingcom-weve-recently-closed-our-activity-7262478689274118148-pjFB?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), Bruno Passos, Group Product Manager on Booking’s Developer Experience team, shared with us that “Using DX to quantify the impact of Sourcegraph has given us confidence in the outcomes it’s driving for our developers. Not only did it confirm that Sourcegraph is helping us ship faster, but these insights are helping us refine and guide our continued rollout.”

He continued: “Using DX and Sourcegraph together has helped us answer a handful of important questions: How much time are we saving using Sourcegraph? Does using Sourcegraph impact quality? And how do AI coding assistants impact the developer experience more broadly?”

## Looking ahead

Going forward, we’ll be continuing to work closely with DX. Customers who are interested in getting an in-depth, third-party assessment of the impact of Sourcegraph within their development teams will be able to by leveraging DX's platform.
