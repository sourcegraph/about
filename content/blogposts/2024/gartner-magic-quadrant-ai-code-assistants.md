We are honored to be recognized by Gartner as a Visionary in the 2024 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for AI Code Assistants. This is the first Magic Quadrant for AI Code Assistants published by Gartner, and Sourcegraph is placed as the only Visionary out of 12 vendors evaluated. We believe this position acknowledges our long-term view of how AI Code Assistants can benefit enterprises, and our focus on pairing the best large language models (LLMs) with relevant context from code and non-code sources will continue to allow developers to tackle hard and complex problems.


## The vision for an AI Code Assistant

The best AI Code Assistants for enterprises make solving the hardest problems feel mundane. From code modernization to fixing security vulnerabilities across a codebase, the tool needs to shy away from hype and instead focus on action to solve an enterprise's most pressing needs.

To do this, the best AI Code Assistant needs both models *and* context to provide the highest quality AI responses and suggestions for developers, and it needs to operate seamlessly with existing environments and requirements. We believe our recognition as a Visionary in the Magic Quadrant validates our philosophy to build such a tool with Sourcegraph Cody, and this philosophy includes:

#### Access to the best models

The best LLM today can quickly be outperformed by another LLM tomorrow, and Cody ensures enterprises never have to settle for second-best by offering LLM interoperability and LLM choice as foundational features. In such a fast-changing market it's important for enterprises to know they aren't locked in with a single model provider or proprietary model, and Cody provides access to the latest models from leading providers like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google.

#### Powered by the best context

A human developer is a function of all the context in their brain from code, issues, bug reports, feature spec docs, and even meetings. The more context a developer has, the more effective they can be.

This same premise applies to AI Code Assistants and Cody uses expansive code and non-code context to be the smartest and most effective AI Code Assistant for enterprises. We've taken our decade-long history of supporting enterprises with the largest codebases search, navigate, and make changes to their code to power the context retrieval capabilities of Cody. Our search expertise allows Cody to retrieve more relevant context, in turn producing higher quality results and suggestions for developers.

We also understand that important context exists outside of the codebase and inside projects, issues, requirements, and docs. Cody can ingest non-code context from your other tools like Jira, Linear, Google Docs, and Notion, using that context to increase the quality and relevance of its answers.

#### Deployed the way you need

Every organization has their own environment or requirements, whether down to preference or mandated by industry standards or regulations. Cody offers enterprises flexible deployment options and is designed to work with existing environments, from support for different code hosts and IDEs through to deployment of Cody via self-hosted, cloud, or Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) means.

This support for flexibility extends to LLMs too. Enterprises can choose LLMs from the Cody Gateway service, or bring their own key via cloud providers such as Amazon Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, or Google Cloud Vertex AI, allowing enterprises to leverage existing vendor agreements or more secure environments while using LLMs within existing VPCs.

## Trusted by the world's largest enterprises

Our vision for AI Code Assistants is validated by some of the largest organizations in the world choosing Sourcegraph, including Leidos, Palo Alto Networks, Bet365, Booking.com, and Blackstone. 

> Cody surveys Blackstone's abundant, fragmented codebases and then writes software code and creates new software.

We are committed to working closely with them to ensure their needs and requirements are met across security, scale, and compliance, regardless of industry or geographic location. [In the words of Qualtrics](https://sourcegraph.com/case-studies/qualtrics-speeds-up-unit-tests-and-code-understanding-with-cody), a global Experience Management (XM) company, “When choosing a coding assistant, we prioritized data loss prevention and assurance of the security of our intellectual property. Cody worked seamlessly with the systems we already had in place.”
