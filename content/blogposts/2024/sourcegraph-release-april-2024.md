### Claude 3 is now available

<br/>

In Sourcegraph 5.3.9104, Claude 3 is now available as an LLM option for chat and autocomplete for Cody Enterprise, bringing Anthropicâ€™s latest models - Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus - to Enterprise users. Sonnet is a [twofold improvement](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family) in speed while remaining just as accurate. Meanwhile, Opus is the most intelligent model from Anthropic yet and has notable improvements in the Needle-In-A-Haystack scoring model, accurately recalling specific context from a large amount of context passed to the model. This translates to more accuracy for Cody when [working with context](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/how-cody-understands-your-codebase) and will enable us to increase the context window for users in the near future.

An upgrade to your Sourcegraph instance is required to use Claude 3 LLMs, as well as the latest version of our [VS Code](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/cody-vscode-1-12-0-release) and [JetBrains](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/cody-jetbrains-5-5-2-release) extensions. [Cody Gateway](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/cody/core-concepts/cody-gateway) customers can configure Claude 3 models by requesting a site-config change. For BYOK Cody customers, Claude 3 is available via [AWS Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/claude/) with support for Haiku and Sonnet, and Opus is [coming soon](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/claude/).
