We are excited to announce the latest release of Sourcegraph's Cody plugin for JetBrains, packed with new features and important bug fixes to enhance your development experience. Let's dive into what's new in this release.

### Claude 3 support for Pro users

Pro users can now take advantage of the newest Claude 3 AI models. Weâ€™ve added both Sonnet and Opus! Choosing these offers even more advanced and contextually aware code suggestions, especially if youâ€™re using Claude 3 Opus.

### Enhanced remote context for Cody Enterprise users

We've fixed a bug that limited the consideration of remote contexts. All remote repositories that you add will now be taken into account when providing code suggestions. This improvement guarantees more accurate and comprehensive responses.

### Intelligent file mentioning

Cody now provides a warning if the selected @-files for context are too large, preventing potential performance issues.
