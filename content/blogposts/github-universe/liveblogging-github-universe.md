Hi, we’re Sourcegraph, the [code search engine](https://sourcegraph.com) for Go and Java that lets you [jump to def and find refs across all your code on GitHub](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/integration/browser_extension). You may remember us from such developer conference liveblogs as [Gophercon](http://gophercon.sourcegraph.com/archive), FOSDEM, and [dotGo](http://dotgo.sourcegraph.com/archive).

This year, we’re excited to announce we’re liveblogging GitHub Universe!

That’s right — we’ll be writing up concise technical summaries of all the talks we can manage. For folks tuning in from home, it’s a great way to stay on top of conference proceedings efficiently throughout the day. For folks at the conference, it’s a great way to remind yourself of the key takeaways of each talk.

The task of liveblogging such a large conference will be a big undertaking, but we’ll do our best. If you’re interested in helping out, [please let us know](https://twitter.com/sourcegraph) and we’ll send you instructions for contributing.

For those of you lucky enough to be at the conference, stop by and say hello! Look for the people wearing (and handing out) “Sourcegraph” T-shirts. And for those of you who are tuning in from home, keep your social media antenna pointed to [@sourcegraph](https://twitter.com/sourcegraph) and this blog post — we’ll link to all liveblog recaps here.

So stay tuned for a fantastic conference with some great new tools and processes for software development. Or in the words of Steve Ballmer, “Developers! Developers! Developers! Developers!”
