We are really excited to announce our latest [integration with Fig](https://fig.io/manual/src)! For those of you who don’t know about Fig, it is a tool that adds IDE-style autocomplete to your existing terminal (currently on macOS.)

When I was onboarding at Sourcegraph one of my todos was to install and learn how to use `src`, a [command-line interface to Sourcegraph](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/cli). The installation was straightforward, but I couldn’t remember all of the different subcommands so I found myself typing `src --help` and [hitting the up arrow](https://www.commitstrip.com/en/2017/02/28/definitely-not-lazy/?) a lot.

Then I remembered Zeno Rocha [tweeting about Fig](https://twitter.com/zenorocha/status/1432709006854869002) and I thought this might be a good opportunity to write an integration. After demoing the proof of concept to my team I got a lot of great feedback and decided to make a [pull request](https://github.com/withfig/autocomplete/pull/1081) to Fig on GitHub.

## Let’s see this in action!

I’m in the process of creating a budget for sponsoring the dependencies that Sourcegraph uses via Open Collective. Here is a real-world example of how I accomplish that.

<div style={{position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '51.13908872901679%', height: 0}}>
    <iframe
        src="https://www.loom.com/embed/46094880c87844958d74ef28b1d76719"
        frameborder="0"
        webkitallowfullscreen
        mozallowfullscreen
        allowfullscreen
        style={{position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%'}}>
    </iframe>
</div>

### Want to try it out?

We got you covered. Install `src` (no login required):

```shell
# via Curl
curl -L https://sourcegraph.com/.api/src-cli/src_darwin_amd64 -o /usr/local/bin/src
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/src

# via Brew
brew install sourcegraph/src-cli/src-cli
```

Next, [download Fig](https://fig.io/invite/?code=DQnRfmaxLn) and open/restart your terminal.

Then type `src` and you should see an IDE-style autocomplete with subcommands and options.

Let us know what you think on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.sourcegraph.com%2Fblog%2Fwhy-fig-autocomplete-is-awesome%2F&text=See%20why%20@sourcegraph%20thinks%20@fig%20is%20awesome%21) or our [Community Slack](https://srcgr.ph/jd-sourcegraph-slack-invite).

Last but not least, a huge thanks to the Fig team ◧ especially [Federico Ciardi](https://twitter.com/fedeci_) for their help. We look forward to working together again!
