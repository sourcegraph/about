[Felicis Ventures](https://www.felicis.com/) has invested an additional $5M in Sourcegraph, bringing our total raised to over $46M, including our $23M [Series B](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/series-b-universal-code-search) in March 2020 led by Craft Ventures. We're seeing rapid growth in the number of companies and developers using Sourcegraph, especially as the pandemic causes dev teams to become temporarily or permanently remote. If you can't tap your colleague on the shoulder to fix or explain something, or absorb context at the watercooler or whiteboard, universal code search becomes even more important.

With this momentum and the investment, we're improving Sourcegraph to provide universal code search to every developer:

*   Building cloud-hosted universal code search (right now, you need to [self-host Sourcegraph](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/#quickstart) to use it on private code)
*   Making virtually all public code searchable on [Sourcegraph Cloud](https://sourcegraph.com/search) by anyone (right now, it only has popular open-source projects)
*   Scaling up our Customer Engineering team to help people spread Sourcegraph to the rest of their company
*   Collaborating with popular open source projects to enable really good code search for each project
*   Starting outreach to students and universities so students can better find answers to their code questions and more quickly learn about codebases

We're hiring for many roles (and we're a permanently [all-remote company](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/company/remote)):
