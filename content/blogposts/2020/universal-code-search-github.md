Sourcegraph [Universal Code Search](/universal-code-search) enables developers to explore and better understand all code, faster, with contextual code intelligence.

This screencast walks you through (with accompanying audio) how to [connect and configure](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/external_service/github) Sourcegraph Universal Code Search for public and private repositories on GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise instances.

In addition to connection configuration, it also discusses important factors for determining which repositories Sourcegraph will index, such as excluding archived repositories, as well as repositories based on naming patterns such `-archived`.
