  - description: Individual batch changes can publish multiple changesets to the same repository by specifying multiple target branches using the `on.branches` attribute. This allows you to efficiently update long-lived branches for recent changes or upgraded dependencies.

  - description: External services will now stop syncing if they exceed the user- or site-level limit for total number of repositories added. They will only continue syncing if the extra repositories are removed or the corresponding limit is increased. Previously, they attempted to retry syncing indefinitely.

Sourcegraph 3.35 is now available! Here are some highlights from this release:

## Precise Code Intelligence for Java, Scala, and Kotlin

Sourcegraph now provides precise Code Intelligence for Java, Scala, and Kotlin. You can now get compiler-accurate “Go to definition” and “Find references” within a Git repository and all transitive dependencies of your codebase. You can find Kotlin or Scala usages from Java code and vice versa, which is particularly useful for mixed-language repositories. [Read more about precise Code Intelligence for Java, Scala, and Kotlin in our blog post](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/java-scala-kotlin-code-intelligence/), and check out our [lsif-java documentation](https://sourcegraph.github.io/lsif-java/) for detailed setup instructions and build-tooling compatibility.

## Efficiently update multiple branches of a repository with Batch Changes

Bumping up a dependency or changing boilerplate code in several branches of the same repository is painful, repetitive work that's a great candidate for a batch change. Batch Changes now allows you to publish changesets to [several branches in the same repository](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/batch_changes/references/batch_spec_yaml_reference#on-repository), rather than a single branch per repository. This is particularly useful, for example, when long-lived branches are used to define versions or releases.
