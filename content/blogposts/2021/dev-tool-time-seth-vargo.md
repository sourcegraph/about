Dev Tool Time is our bi-monthly virtual event series in which guest developers share their favorite dev tools and productivity hacks. We welcomed [Seth Vargo](#seth-vargo) as our first guest on April 14, 2021. You can watch the live stream video on [YouTube Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sltjIaAwWac) or at the [bottom](#seth-vargo) of this blog post.

Seth was generous in sharing his dev productivity secrets, including how to leverage keyboard shortcuts, a hack for setting up a new computer in record time, and his [.gitconfig](https://gist.github.com/sethvargo/d10a81f219f6469889269af2076b4d39) containing the [Git aliases](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases) you need to become a Git ninja.

He also talked about the importance of screen real estate and showed us his desk setup that's optimized for productivity. Here is a summary of the setup and tools he mentioned:

## Seth's desk setup for productivity

### [LG 5K monitor](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HMUB2LL/A/lg-ultrafine-5k-display)

This monitor comes with a built-in USB-C hub to charge his MacBook at 96 watts, his Stream Deck and to connect his [Thunderbolt-based wired Ethernet](https://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/TB3ADP10GBE/).

### [Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck)

Each Stream Deck button is assigned to run something, for example one button shows his CPU usage, another the CI status when he's running a build, while another sends him straight to his GitHub notifications. He loves that it's highly customizable, adapts to the current app, integrates with a ton of community-built apps, accelerates his workflow, and adds a little fun factor.

### [Elgato 4K Cam Link](https://www.elgato.com/en/cam-link-4k)

This allows Seth to stream with his DSLR camera and he gets many compliments on how great his video quality is.

Below is the rest of Seth's kit:

- [Blue Yeti Microphone](http://bluemic.com/)
- Teleprompter
- [RODE Shotgun Microphone](https://www.rode.com/microphones/videomicpro)
- [Sony a6500 camera](https://www.sony.com/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-6500-body-kit)

## Seth's key dev tools

Seth's workflow focuses aggressively on keyboard shortcuts and quick navigation between workspaces. He has a few tools that have become indispensable:

### [SizeUp window manager](https://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/)

SizeUp allows Seth to quickly resize and position his windows with keyboard shortcuts at pixel precision.

### [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)

Seth likes iTerm for loading his preferences from a URL. Seth keeps his .dot files with all his settings synced in a Git repository to fast-track new computer setups.

### Git

Seth makes heavy use of [Git aliases](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases), with which he shortens useful Git commands. Check out his amazing [.gitconfig](https://gist.github.com/sethvargo/d10a81f219f6469889269af2076b4d39) which, among other things, also shows how to prettify and format your Git log.

### [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Visual Studio Code is Seth's favorite IDE, and his color scheme of choice is [Default Material Dark](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yuchiu2002.default-material-dark-theme). He uses the [Material Product Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-product-icons) theme for his icons. He also uses the [Go Plugin for VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/go) to help with auto-formatting, so he doesn't have to worry about indentation or tabs versus spaces. These are his [VS Code configurations](https://gist.github.com/sethvargo/d565d2ce0bdd54c8248fcd4c808ca1a4).

> ### Words of Wisdom:
>
> _“Formatting is owned by the repository… the linting configuration is a property
> of the repository not a property of the user.”_

Seth also swears by [Cinch](https://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/cinch/), a mouse-based window manager, as well as [Terraform](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HashiCorp.terraform) and [Cloud Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GoogleCloudTools.cloudcode) plugins (although we didn't get to cover the last two in the live stream).
