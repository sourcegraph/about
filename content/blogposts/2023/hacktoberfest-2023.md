üôè _Please do not spam contributions with Cody or other generative AI, as it burdens maintainers._

It's time to get excited for [Hacktoberfest 2023](https://hacktoberfest.com/)! This year, [Cody](https://cody.dev) can help you make contributions to the open source community. 

With Cody, you can make high-quality contributions to open source projects more efficiently and effectively. For example, you can use Cody to:

* **Document code:** Cody can generate documentation comments for the code you have selected. 
* **Explain code:** Cody can generate clear and concise documentation for code. 
* **Generate unit tests:** Cody can generate unit tests for your code, which can help you ensure that the project‚Äôs code is working as expected.
* **And much more**: Code autocomplete, code smells, custom commands, and other features to help you be more productive.

Before starting with contributions to a project, it is important to learn what the project does. The [Cody Web App](https://sourcegraph.com/cody) and supported IDE extensions ([VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcegraph.cody-ai), [JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9682-sourcegraph-cody--code-search), [Neovim](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sg.nvim)) allow you to ask questions about specific repositories. For example, you can choose [Hugging Face‚Äôs Transformers repo](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/huggingface/transformers) and ask what it does, what the tech stack is, who the contributors are, etc.

### Documentation

#### For comments

To generate documentation comments for your code, select the code you want to document and then run the `/doc` command. Cody will generate documentation comments in the appropriate format for your programming language.

**Example:**

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

**Doc output:**

Hugging Face is having a [Doc Tests Sprint](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/16292). Use Cody to create some [docstring examples](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/16292)!


#### For docs

To generate code explanations for documentation, select the code you want to explain and then run the `/explain` command. Cody will generate an explanation in plain language format that is easy to understand.

**Example:**

```javascript
function celsiusToFahrenheit(celsius) {
    return celsius * 9 / 5 + 32;
  }
```

**Explain output:**

_‚ÄúSo in simple terms, it takes a Celsius temperature, converts it to Fahrenheit using the standard formula, and returns the Fahrenheit temperature. This allows the caller to easily convert between temperature scales.‚Äù_

WireMock is looking for documentation clean-up and gaps. [Help them](https://github.com/wiremock/community/issues/47)!


### Generate Unit Tests

To generate unit tests with Cody, select the code you want to test and then run the `/test` command. Cody will generate unit tests in the appropriate format for your programming language.  

**Example:**

Using the same code above, Cody was able to generate a unit test for the `celsiusToFahrenheit` function.

**Test output:**

Apache StreamPipes is looking to [implement unit tests](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/issues/1893). Give it a try with the `/test `command!


### Respect the maintainers

**Please ensure you don‚Äôt overwhelm maintainers with pull requests they aren‚Äôt looking for.** If they have an issue that Cody can help you help them with, go for it!
