The Cody for VS Code v0.18.0 update introduces a new chat interface, allowing for side-by-side chat windows, a reworked context dropdown that shows file names and line ranges, and improved context control using the new Enhanced Context Selector.

## New Chat Interface

Chats now open alongside your code, in a larger window, without needing the Cody sidebar open. This means you can have multiple chats open side-by-side and configure them to give more space to read longer code blocks. You can also manage your chats directly in the sidebar.

## Context Controls

Cody‚Äôs chat view has a completely reworked context dropdown that shows not just the file names but also the exact line ranges that Cody used to provide a chat response. This helps you understand exactly what additional context was included. You can also click any of the context items to open the file with line range selected.

/>

You can now control whether Cody fetches additional context (e.g. Embeddings), using the new Enhanced Context button in the chat message text input. When enabled, Cody fetches embeddings and includes them with your message to get the best responses from the LLM. When disabled, only @-included files or symbols with be included as context.

We‚Äôve also updated `@-mentioning` a file or symbol (`@#-`) in chat so it now supports fuzzy filename searching, letting you quickly find the context you‚Äôd like Cody to  include:

## Autocomplete Improvements

/>

Autocomplete is now better at detecting when you need to generate a block of code, giving you a single multi-line suggestion instead of needing to generate it line-by-line:

/>


We also extended these multi-line completions to code within brackets, so Cody now generates fully expanded parameters for you in a single suggestion:

/>

If you want to request an autocompletion suggestion manually, we‚Äôve updated the command so it now appears properly labeled in the VS Code command palette and keybindings:

/>

## Code Editing Improvements

We‚Äôve made a huge range of improvements to Cody‚Äôs code editing command, including increased quality of generated code, auto-applying of edits, auto-formatting of code, streaming responses, a new ‚ÄúRetry‚Äù option to retry an edit with an updated prompt, and 3 new code actions:

* Ask Cody to Edit
* Ask Cody to Generate
* Ask Cody to Document

/>

## New Search UI 

We discovered that lots of users were using Cody chat to search for code snippets in their codebase but not getting the results they expected. We‚Äôve added a new natural language search feature that uses a local index of your open project to surface code snippets that approximately match a description.

## Inline Chat Removed

We've removed inline chat as part of the new chat interface changes. Inline chat was built on top of VS Code‚Äôs File Commenting API, which proved too difficult to provide a reliable and intuitive chat experience and provide high-quality chat responses. We‚Äôll continue to revisit inline chat experiences as the VS Code team releases non-private APIs available for others to use.
