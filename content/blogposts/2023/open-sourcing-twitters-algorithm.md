We're eager to see Twitter's algorithm go open source today at 12pm PDT. We love a good code dump. What interesting stuff will we find in the code?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Algorithm goes open source at noon Pacific Time</p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1641680913661607936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 31, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async="true" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Sourcegraph devs (and [our Discord community](https://discord.gg/rDPqBejz93)) will be liveblogging the most interesting things we see once it's published. Follow along here for updates!

#### 2:15am PDT: start the countdown

[@sqs](https://twitter.com/sqs): A little under 10 hours to go until it's open source. We'll be back closer to 12pm PDT (unless Twitter unexpectedly releases it early, which might happen!). If you want to start exploring the rest of Twitter's open-source code in the meantime, here's a [starting point](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/twitter/+algorithm&patternType=standard&sm=0&groupBy=repo).

#### 11:50am PDT: Pushed

The code is now live: https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/twitter/the-algorithm

We are digging in!
