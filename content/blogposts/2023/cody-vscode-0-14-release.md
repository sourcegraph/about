[Cody for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcegraph.cody-ai) v0.14 is now available and includes improvements to the `/doc` and `/test` commands, a new mode configuration for custom commands, and experimental smart selection.


## Smart selection for `/doc` and `/test`

You can now use the `/doc` and `/test` commands without selecting any code first, and Cody will use the position of your cursor to guess out what you're wanting to document or code.

This feature is still under development, please give it a test and provide feedback.
## Inline Documentation with /doc

The `/doc` command now adds the generated documentation directly above your selected code. You no longer need to copy and paste the generated documentation from the chat view.

## New custom command modes 

Custom commands now support a new `mode` configuration field that allows commands to be customized for how Cody should execute them:

- `inline` (default) - Runs the prompt in the inline chat window 
- `edit` - Runs the prompt on the selected code for refactoring workflows
- `insert` - Runs the prompt and inserts the response on top of the selection

This enables custom commands to be tailored for specific use cases like refactoring or documentation generation.

<!-- TODO add link to updated docs here -->

## New code block actions in chat

We added a new "Save to File..." button on code blocks in the chat view. This allows you to easily extract and save code Cody generates to a file in your project.
