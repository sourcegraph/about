[Cody for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcegraph.cody-ai) v0.14 is now available and includes improvements to the `/doc` and `/test` commands, a new mode configuration for custom commands, and experimental smart selection.

## Inline Documentation with /doc

Previously when using the `/doc` command, the generated documentation would be shown in the chat view. It will now directly insert the documentation text right above the selected code in your editor. This makes it easier to quickly add documentation stubs as you code.

<!-- TODO add example screenshot here -->

## Experimental smart selection

We've started work on a smart selection capability that will automatically determine what code to run the `/doc` and `/test` commands on based on heuristics like scope and recent activity. This will remove the need to manually highlight code before generating documentation or tests.

Smart selection is still experimental but we're excited about the potential to streamline workflows.

## New custom command modes 

Custom commands now support a new `mode` configuration field that allows commands to be customized for how Cody should execute them:

- `inline` (default) - Runs the prompt in the inline chat window 
- `edit` - Runs the prompt on the selected code for refactoring workflows
- `insert` - Runs the prompt and inserts the response on top of the selection

This enables custom commands to be tailored for specific use cases like refactoring or documentation generation.

## Save code blocks to files

We added a new "Save to File..." button on code blocks in the chat view. This allows you to easily extract and save code Cody generates to a file in your project.
