[Cody for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcegraph.cody-ai) v0.10 is now available, and includes command menu UX improvements, JSON export, JSON format changes to custom commands, autocomplete rate limit visibility, and autocomplete TLS connection reuse.

### Command UX improvements ‚ö°Ô∏è

The Cody command menu (accessible anywhere using the keyboard shortcut Opt-C or Alt-C) has been improved to xyz:

### JSON export of chat history üíø

The new "Export JSON" button in Chat History allows you to export and inspect your chat history as JSON:

The export includes the full conversation between Cody and the LLM, allowing you to see how Cody works, send your chat history to Sourcegraph support, and more easily develop custom commands.

```json
{
    "Sun, 03 Sep 2023 14:00:44 GMT": {
        "id": "2023-09-03T14:00:44.696Z",
        "interactions": [
            {
                "humanMessage": { ... },
                "assistantMessage": { ... },
                "fullContext": [
                    { ... }
                ]
            }
        ]
        
    }
}
```

### Updated custom command JSON format üìÑ

[Custom Cody Commands](TODO) is an experimental feature for extending and customizing Cody. They can be configured locally, or shared with your team by checking them in to your repository.

We‚Äôve updated the JSON configuration format so it now requires a `slashCommand` (it's used as the configuration key) and replaced the command name with a sentence-cased `description`:

```diff
{
    "commands": {
-       "My Custom Command": {
+       "my-custom-command": {
-           "slashCommand": "/my-custom-command",
+           "description": "My custom command",
            "command": "node my-custom-context.js",
            "prompt": "My custom prompt"
        }
    }
}
```

Old configuration files will be automatically updated to the new format. It's recommended you also update your custom command descriptions to use sentence case, to match the built-in Cody commands.

### Autocomplete rate limit visibiity üëÄ

We‚Äôve improved the visiblity of [autocompletion rate limits](TODO). When a rate limit is being applied the Cody statusbar icon now changes color. The settings menu also provides information about the rate limit, and links through to the documentation.

### Increased autocomplete speed with TLS connection reuse üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüí®

We added support for reusing TLS connections, resulting in a 5-10% speed up of autocomplete responses. Due to VS Code limitations, to enable TLS connection reuse you must configure your VS Code "Http: Proxy Support" setting to "off":

```json
{
    "http.proxySupport": "off"
}
```

### Changelog üì∞

See the [changelog](https://github.com/sourcegraph/cody/blob/main/vscode/CHANGELOG.md) and [GitHub releases](https://github.com/sourcegraph/cody/releases) for a complete list of changes.
