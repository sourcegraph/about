[Cody for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcegraph.cody-ai) v0.10 is now available, and includes command menu UX improvements, JSON export, JSON format changes to custom commands, autocomplete rate limit visibility, and autocomplete TLS connection reuse.

### Command menu UX improvements

The Cody command menu (accessible anywhere using the keyboard shortcut Opt-C or Alt-C) now shows the slash commands, both `/ask` and `/edit` take an argument:

And we've improved support for just typing a question or edit and hitting Enter:

We've also updated the chat command menu to clearly separate the built-in commands and custom commands:

### Chat history JSON export

The new "Export" button in Chat History allows you to export and inspect your chat history as JSON:

The export includes the full conversation between Cody and the LLM, allowing you to see how Cody works, send your chat history to Sourcegraph support, and more easily develop custom commands.

    "Sun, 03 Sep 2023 14:00:44 GMT": {
        "id": "2023-09-03T14:00:44.696Z",
        "interactions": [
            {
                "humanMessage": { ... },
                "assistantMessage": { ... },
                "fullContext": [
                    { ... }
                ]
            }
        ]
        
    }
}
```

### Updated custom command JSON format

Custom Cody Commands is an experimental feature for extending and customizing Cody. They can be configured locally, or shared with your team by checking them in to your repository.

Weâ€™ve updated the JSON configuration format so it now requires a `slashCommand` (it's used as the configuration key) and replaced the command name with a sentence-cased `description`:

```diff
{
    "commands": {
-       "My Custom Command": {
+       "my-custom-command": {
-           "slashCommand": "/my-custom-command",
+           "description": "My custom command",
            "command": "node my-custom-context.js",
            "prompt": "My custom prompt"
        }
    }
}
```

Old configuration files will be automatically updated to the new format. It's recommended you also update your custom command descriptions to use sentence case, to match the built-in Cody commands.

### Autocomplete rate limit visibiity

Weâ€™ve improved the visiblity of [autocompletion rate limits](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/cody/troubleshooting#autocomplete-rate-limits). When a rate limit is being applied the Cody statusbar icon now changes color. The settings menu also provides information about the rate limit, and links through to the documentation.

### Autocomplete and streaming improvements

Autocompletions will now appear faster. We improved autocompletion latency, resulting in 40% faster multi-line completions and 10% faster single-line completions.
