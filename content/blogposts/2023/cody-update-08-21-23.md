Hey folks! Wow, it's been a minute since our last Cody update. The past couple months have been a wild ride as we've seen tons more users hop on Cody ever since we opened it up to the [public](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/cody-for-open-source). We're so excited to share a few awesome updates that we think y'all will love in Cody version 0.8.0!


## Completion improvements
// todo

Cody has been given a brain boost to give you even faster and more accurate code completions. The team has used the last couple of months to really iron out what a good experience looks like, with huge improvements to response latency and accuracy. Cody now leverages better prompt engineering and more advanced prompt structuring to get the most out of Claude, which boosts Cody's ability to generate relevant code snippets in mere milliseconds. 

Don't believe it? Go try it for yourself by downloading [Cody for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcegraph.cody-ai)!
