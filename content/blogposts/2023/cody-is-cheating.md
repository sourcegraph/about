*Stevey‚Äôs ‚ÄúCheating With Cody‚Äù blog series, Episode 2*

I swear I will never make you read [that much](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/cheating-is-all-you-need) again. Haha, kidding, this one is 3000 pages too. 

But I might have to start doing this as often as weekly, since stuff changes so fast. I mean it‚Äôs only been *six weeks* since I posted about Cody and Marge and the whole cheating affair, but the whole world has changed *dramatically*, as you will see in our action-packed second installment of my new *Cheating with Cody* blog post series.

The pilot episode, *Cheating is All You Need*, generated plenty of both excitement and confusion. And definitely there was a lot of interest in the new badges. üòâ

In today‚Äôs episode, I will explain our moat: **How exactly Cody is differentiated** over all other coding assistants, including Copilot, and why we will always be the leader.

In upcoming Episode 3, next week, I will show you Cody in action.

Did I mention I‚Äôm lucky? Well, this is the world poker tournament of software showdowns. This is the Big One. And I got pocket rockets. True story: Yesterday, **Bill Gates flew out** to visit one of our huge customers, trying to woo them into choosing Copilot over Cody. He cast all of his magic spells. I‚Äôve seen what he and Satya can do. They are magicians when it comes to vaporware and spin.

And then we showed that same customer a Cody demo, and haw, haw, HAW HAW HAAAa8 \*cough\* \*cough\* HAAAAAAaaaagh, I‚Äôm dying here. Of *course* they picked us. Bill was wasting his time. I‚Äôve been waiting to do that to him for 35 years, and it felt *good*.

Because there is truly no comparison to Cody. We‚Äôre so far ahead. It‚Äôs blowing people‚Äôs minds at Copilot shops. You‚Äôll see soon enough!

But first! I want to explain *why*, so that you understand this isn‚Äôt some marketing gimmick. *Cody knows a tremendous and surprising amount about your code* and it is **unreasonably powerful**. It‚Äôs no joke. If you‚Äôre patient I‚Äôll show you a video.

It‚Äôs already *almost* as if we‚Äôve trained the LLM on your whole code base. Cody does a *bang-up* job of being an actual, bona-fide *coding assistant*. Not an autocompleter, not a GPT sidebar. An actual assistant. A whole team of them, in fact. You will be amazed.

BUT, many of our Enterprise customers and prospects are **already familiar with Cody** and simply want to understand our key ‚Äúmoat‚Äù differentiators vs. Copilot. So that will be the main focus of this post. We also have whitepapers about all this coming soon.

Before I jump into the gory details, let‚Äôs recap what‚Äôs changed since Episode 1.

#### The Rise and Fall of the GPT Empire

Here‚Äôs the TL;DR for what happened last week. For a more action-packed account, see my recent Medium post, *[We‚Äôre Gonna Need a Bigger Moat](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/were-gonna-need-a-bigger-moat-478a8df6a0d2)*. I‚Äôll just share a recap here.

First, a leaked memo from a Google researcher, ‚Äú[We have no moat, and neither does OpenAI](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither)‚Äù, showed that **open-source LLM performance is rapidly catching OpenAI/Google**, for specific domains and apps.

And second, [Geoffrey Hinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton), the so-called Godfather of Deep Learning, quit to go on a world tour talking about SkyNet.

The recent chain of events could probably make for an actual blockbuster movie, but for now, to summarize, let‚Äôs continue the history lesson I started in *Cheating is All You Need*. One paragraph!
