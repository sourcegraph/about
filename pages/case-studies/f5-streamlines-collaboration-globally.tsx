            F5 focuses on the development, delivery, security, performance, and availability of web
            applications across any multi-cloud environment. The team behind its next-gen software
            infrastructure project started with zero code a year and a half ago, and now has more than 350
            repositories, multiple programming languages, and 125 developers across six different time
            zones. This project will live for 10+ years, and the code will inevitably grow by orders of
            magnitude during that time.
        </p>
        <h2 className="pt-5 pb-1">Knocking down silos</h2>
        
        <p>
            Sourcegraph supports collaboration across F5’s teams by indexing code so that developers can
            easily find what they’re looking for across the entire codebase.
        </p>
        
        <h2 className="pt-5 pb-1">Overcoming API boundaries</h2>
        <p>
            Sourcegraph empowers teams across different API boundaries to communicate and work together more
            effectively. Developers at F5 now have a common way to discuss their code, understand
            dependencies, and see how one team is using the other team's APIs.
        </p>
        
        <h2 className="pt-5 pb-1">Bringing teams together</h2>
        <p>
            F5 is comprised of teams that work more than 12 hours apart in different time zones. Sourcegraph
            makes communication simple by enabling developers to read and understand each others’ code.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            With Sourcegraph, F5's global workforce can stay better connected and quickly solve problems
            across the entire codebase.
